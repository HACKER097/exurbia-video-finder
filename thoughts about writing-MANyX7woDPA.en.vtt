00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.960
Well, I'm bored – and you must be too, if you clicked on this,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.200
so let's go for a bike ride and talk about creativity, shall we?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.280
If you shit in the roses again, you're going back to Portsmouth.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800
I don't know what that means, either.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.680
I love you !..

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.160
You will find endless resources out there about how to make and edit videos,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.140
and I don't know anything about all that anyway.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.840
But not a lot gets said on this platform about writing, and that seems kind of weird –

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.260
because quite a lot of good content is good writing.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.220
So, I'm gonna say an overdue "thank you" for the arbitrary subscriber milestone a while ago

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.260
with a rather uninformed, self-indulgent, and misguided rant about how at least I go about writing.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.120
And I hope – for someone – it helps.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.160
And since I have no idea what the hell I'm talking about,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.580
I'm gonna condense all of this down to five handy sound bites

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.520
that I completely pulled out of my ass, and add long words and jokes

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.960
to lend myself the brief illusion of credibility.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.820
Devise a personal science.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.480
If you go on a creative writing course, they generally talk a lot about the writing, but rarely the creativity part.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.060
Which is odd, because that's how everything starts.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.000
Myself – I go running in the mornings, drink 15 pots of coffee, do some housework,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.160
and sometimes, if one is slept properly, and Cthulhu is in a good mood,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.680
you will misread a line of text or mishear something in conversation, and suddenly, for no reason, you've got something.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.280
Ideas are fickle bastards, and they float above in the ether laughing at you,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.900
and they will only come down if you aren't looking directly at them.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.160
In my experience, ideas do not turn up fully formed, anyway – they usually come to you as little embers that you have to fan,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.940
and sometimes they go nowhere, and other times, for no apparent reason, they take off by themselves.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.400
For every excuse for content I personally put out, about four or five scripts go in the bin.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.680
"Mom! Mom, come here, I fucking got it!"

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.540
But you didn't got it – it was ridiculous, and it didn't work.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.640
A surprising amount of doing this isn't actually writing – it's letting go of stuff you thought might work

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.080
in preparation for something you hope will work better.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.260
However, I believe there IS a science to creativity, for finding the optimal conditions for having ideas.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.740
The problem is, it's a science of one. It's entirely personal to you.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.980
I would encourage you to watch the inside of your own head and notice when the fireworks go off,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.860
and try to recreate those conditions.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.820
We live in minds we do not understand,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.560
but one doesn't have to understand the machine to determine the optimal conditions for use.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.640
It just takes a bit of experimentation and self observation.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.540
Look at shit other people have made.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.980
Everyone I know who went somewhere creatively got into their respective fields

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.960
because they initially loved the field itself.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.500
The painters have their heroes, the writers have their saints.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.980
And because they started as fans or lovers of their field,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.640
they know a lot about what people have done before in those fields.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.300
No one can read all the books or visit all the galleries in the world – there'll always be gaps in one's knowledge.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.800
But to have a half-decent overview of what's come before not only gives one a sense of the craft,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.300
but it populates one's toolbox, allowing for plagiarism.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.060
but it populates one's toolbox, allowing for p̶l̶a̶g̶i̶a̶r̶i̶s̶m̶ borrowing tricks from the greats.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.800
At the same time, there's nothing wrong with trying to get into a field one knows very little about –

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.140
one will learn on the way anyway.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.680
But if I could be so bold, I'd say that in either case it must be from love.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.560
Because if one loves the art form, love will keep on working long after deadlines and coffee have run out.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.240
Look into how other people made shit in the first place.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.160
I love "2001: A Space Odyssey". It's the first serious film I ever saw.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.900
My dad showed it to me when I was very little,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.860
and for the next week or so I apparently just kept screaming if we didn't rewatch it in the evenings.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.600
The film took on this kind of religious quality in my childhood,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.060
and a few years back I had the pleasure of going to an exhibition full of the original props and stuff.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.260
That was fun, but what was really neat was reading the letters between Arthur C. Clarke, the sci-fi writer,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.560
and Stanley Kubrick, the director, and realizing –

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.520
oh! There was this massive period of time before the film was made

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.620
when they had no idea what the fuck they were doing.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.560
Because it's such a perfect movie to me that you can just kind of believe it made itself,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.380
or that they filmed it in a few weeks, and bada-bing, job done.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.160
But in reality great work takes years to bake sometimes,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.520
and great artists generally don't have much interest in bragging afterwards about how much preparation went into the cake itself.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.260
I would strongly urge you to find out how artists you respect made their stuff,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.040
because there's always a story there, and it's usually a very difficult one.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.740
But the end result looks effortless.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.560
For the writers out there, my Bible for a long time now has been "Zen in the Art of Writing" by Ray Bradbury.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.520
I hope you enjoy it.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.080
There's some kind of long-enduring myth that great art usually just turns up fully formed,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.840
and if you're having trouble – it's because you're not naturally gifted or something.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.580
WOWIE, what a load of bollocks!

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.080
There are ENDLESS resources for help with arting, if you will only seek them out.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.340
There are artists who started at 50 or 60,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.300
there are artists with debilitating diseases,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.860
there are artists living in war zones.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.200
Great art is possible in almost all conditions.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.540
And don't even think about taking up smoking, please!

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.600
There is no shame in making simple shit.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.980
We're living in a rather paradoxical age of media.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.060
It's never been easier to get one's work out there, but as a result, people's attention spans have probably never been shorter.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.760
I was at a conference many years back, and I come to listen to a debate between two philosophers about the point of life,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.540
And what happened instead was lots and lots of long words, when in fact they were talking about very graspable stuff –

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.100
"What are we doing here", "what's the point in being alive", etc.,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.500
And I sat there for hours thinking:

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.140
"You could just talk like normal people.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.740
Why aren't you talking like normal people?

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.340
The meat of what you're actually saying isn't that complicated."

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.420
And I realized those folks on stage were probably scared – scared of being seen as stupid.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.780
And so instead, they'd ended up being all obscure with big silly long words.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.180
But really, isn't it way more impressive to say a complex thing in a simple way

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.960
than a simple thing in a complex way?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.240
If you're writing or making something that isn't working,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.820
it might be because you're worried about being called stupid, and you're making it too complicated.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.280
I do this all the time!

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.180
I reckon it's way more awe-inspiring to watch a cartoon and notice the thing goes deeper than you first realized,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.140
than to read something patting itself on the back for being "high art"

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.500
and notice there aren't actually any decent ideas in there underneath all the pretension and pomposity.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.580
If I may be so arrogant – if you're having creative problems, I would recommend being as simple as you can, and no simpler.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.120
People really, really appreciate humans who talk and act like humans.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.800
Your mileage may vary, of course – it's all a question of taste,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.240
and it's just a thought, and what the fuck do I know, anyway?

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.360
Your subconscious is smarter than you are.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.840
I can't stand it when people bang on about their own stuff to illustrate the point,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.560
but just allow me a small episode of self-indulgence here.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.080
I was in the US a while ago, wandering around a museum, and I chanced on this gorgeous statuette of a Hindu deity –

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.640
sorry, I don't remember which one –

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.220
but it had many arms, and it was metal, and the metal was such that it looked quite sci-fi, and I thought:

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.560
"Huh. Be kind of cool if that was a god of the future."

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.240
And the idea would not go away.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.840
Everything I tried to work on subsequently was boring, because I knew, or I hoped,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.200
there was something in that initial idea in that museum.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.100
So I gave in and tried writing the script –

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.180
first person, second person, third person –

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.540
it was shit every time.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.980
But it still wouldn't go away, and I was starting to go a bit mad.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.340
Weeks of this, and finally the script... sort of worked in the third person?

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.600
But by then I realized I couldn't fucking animate the thing, 'cause I can't fucking animate.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.100
So that was another three weeks of trying every approach I could, and going quite properly reclusive by this point –

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.360
and only then did an approach sort of turn up.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.540
And finally, about four months after starting the thing, it was finished.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.180
If you've seen it, it was the one about the old woman and the snake on the mountain. Whatever.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.500
But I'm just saying: if you intuitively have some sense that something is there, and it won't leave you alone,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.700
It might be a long process of trying to make the thing real,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.300
but it's almost always worth it in the end, it really is –

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.000
if even just to have finished the thing, good or bad.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.720
Refine mercilessly.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.260
So, you've made a thing, or you have a first draft or something. Well done.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.680
Now, unless you're Mozart, you probably didn't just write or paint or code a classic on the first try.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.640
One has to go back and prune, and prune, and prune.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.440
The trick, if you have time, is to wait a week, or a few days, or even just sleep on it,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.340
and go back to the thing with new eyes.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.760
When the pride of finishing the thing has faded, you can suddenly see it more objectively,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.980
and be willing to remove stuff that's miscellaneous.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.200
Just like Papa Hemingway said – "the first draft of anything is shit".

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.480
There are some folks on YouTube I follow very closely,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.360
and I've noticed the one thing they all have in common is really good signal-to-noise ratio.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.480
Whatever they're talking about, they're being quite careful not to waste your time.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.700
They've clearly gone back and edited out the parts that were irrelevant or peripheral, or refined the script or the idea over and over.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.060
One only ever sees the end result of hard work,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.760
but in reality good shit usually took endless go-overs, and rewrites, and revisions.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.800
Far as I can tell with other people's work, anyway.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.120
If your thing feels like it will never get properly polished –

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.280
good; that's exactly how one feels before polishing something up.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.660
The hard part is already over. You'll be fine.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.720
You'll be fine!

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.680
You don't choose where the cat sleeps.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.680
Some time ago, I purchased a not inexpensive bed for my feline life companion,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.300
for those rare moments of downtime during her terribly hectic life.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.060
Oh, another busy day, is it?!

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.080
She was briefly interested in the fancy bed,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.520
but preferred to just sleep next to me in the human bed, and that's fine.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.080
Recently, though, a cardboard box turned up in my apartment.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.660
For whatever reason this became the cat's overwhelming preference for a sleeping spot,

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.080
despite having a lovely soft warm bed to retire to,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.580
and I've just fucking given up.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.800
Well, making stuff is a bit like that, too.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.720
You can jiggle and rearrange words trying to trick your audience into coming away with a particular feeling or sense,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.580
but they know when you're bullshitting, or trying to be a smartass.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.340
I've heard this time and time again on YouTube, and found it myself –

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.840
if you make something trying to pander to what you assume is popular, people always know somehow.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.740
Whereas sometimes you have an idea on the bus you assume only you will find funny, cobble it together on a rainy weekend,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.320
and occasionally there's this disproportionate response to the thing that makes no sense.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.000
Maybe you struck a chord, and you have no idea why, and you'll NEVER know why.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.240
You can acquire a cat; you don't get to choose where the cat sleeps.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.600
You can spend as much time as you want on making a thing;

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.680
you don't get to choose how the audience reacts.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.160
Obligatory pseudo-intellectual high note ending.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.400
Occasionally, people will make out that passion is a lie peddled by Hollywood or life coaches.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.020
They will advise you to only put artificial sweetener in your tea,

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.140
and insist that the world is organized and uniform,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.020
and don't waste your time following things you love!

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.700
Mmm, cooking chocolate! The best dessert!

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.460
But passion is a thing. It's a massive, massive fixture of the human experience.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.260
And if one is lucky enough to have a particular ambition or passion –

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.440
well, I think we've all met people who didn't follow the thing, and subsequently regretted it forever.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.940
Obviously, there are plenty of starving artists out there.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.380
I'm not saying "sell all your worldly possessions and start painting Hieronymus Bosch triptychs with your arse".

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.300
But if you think you might be a – quote – "creative at heart", and making stuff makes you happy –

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.680
or worse, NOT making stuff makes you unhappy –

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.520
then why not see if you can really properly pursue the thing?

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.640
Everyone who did a cool creative thing usually gave it long nights, and early mornings, and all the energy they had.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.320
But if it's what you enjoy, it isn't really a struggle at all –

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.980
it's just love in disguise.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.820
*Bleargh*

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.340
It can be done alongside a sensible job, in a sensible way, playing as a real person by day,

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.800
meanwhile building something like a maniac at night.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.020
I naïvely believe that one day our descendants will look back on our condition as tragic.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.700
We are very clever animals, and very stupid super-beings.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.360
We're held hostage by our brain chemistry,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.060
by the dice roll of our birth conditions,

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.720
by the constraints of our history.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.740
It will probably seem amazing one day that we even managed to live like this,

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.920
and eventually, we will be something different – and, hopefully, better.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.460
but that era is not now.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.340
Alongside the picnic days of life many of us are, of course, predisposed to angst, to despair,

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.320
to trying to ignore what looks like a hole in the bottom of everything.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.000
But I would like to put it to you, if I may, that in arting,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.380
in trying to make a new thing, in trying to say something true about the weird experiment we're running down here,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.980
it is possible to collect up some of the angst, and despair, and fear, and externalize them.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.420
And even if they're not gone then, at least we know we're all on the same road together,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.940
and that there's plenty of road ahead,

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.940
and one day the view will be nicer.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.380
I believe that is probably the main function of art:

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.420
to lie as truthfully as possible, and to try to capture some aspects of our condition that we all suffer with,

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.140
but haven't addressed together yet.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.740
And that is quite enough pseudo-self-help from me.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.140
If you're perpetually waiting to start making something you think only you could make –

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.160
then please, would you start now?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.300
Impose deadlines,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.760
captain a ship of one,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.720
go wander about in the forests of your own weird subconscious.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.240
Link below for some stuff that helped me out, anyway.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.140
In all, I really just wanted to say thanks,

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.480
and I have no idea why you're watching my excuse for work, but I'm just very, very grateful indeed.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.020
You won't need it, but all the same, just in case –

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.960
with your creative adventures ahead, all the very, very best of luck.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.140
And once again,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.320
please stop procrastinating...

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.320
Now.
