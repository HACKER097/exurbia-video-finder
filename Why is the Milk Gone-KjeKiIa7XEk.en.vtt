00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.510
Motherfuc-

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.200
Why is the milk gone?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.630
Well because you forgot to buy milk, alright?

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.120
And why did you forget to buy milk?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.120
Well.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.270
That's an interesting question.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.280
See you were gonna some on the way
home yesterday but then you remembered

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.570
you had to get some bread as well so you went to the bread aisle.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.820
However the alcohol aisle was on the way to the bread aisle so you went there first because

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.190
recently you've been doing quite a lot of drinking alone (if by recently you mean the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.800
last 12 years) and they had this new 45% bourbon which was pretty cool, which you bought and

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.040
then forgot to buy milk.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.160
So really the milk is gone because of whisky.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.659
But really you only went to buy whisky because it's kind of been a cloudy day and you wanted

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:53.660
to cheer yourself up a bit.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.040
And it's only really been a cloudy day because of temperature differential over the balkan

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.260
peninsula, brought on by east moving winds and pressure fluctuations.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.630
So really the milk is gone because of the weather.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.000
But the weather is only really there because of the atmosphere which formed about 4 billion

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.670
years ago, as a result of gas escaping from the Earth's interior.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.729
So the milk is gone because of the Earth.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.390
But the Earth is only really there because a gas cloud condensed into the sun and the solar

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.049
system a few billion ago.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.860
And all of that came from the big bang, billions of years before that. So really the milk is

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.870
gone because space and time materialized out of apparently nothing... 14 billion years ago.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.080
And if that's true did the universe know 14 billion years ago that if she exploded, formed

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.960
into galaxies and stars and they gave rise to planets and the planets developed ecosystems,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.110
single celled life, complex organisms, humans,
human society, domestication of cows,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.190
the invention of coffee, milk in coffee, fridges
and finally you, that you that you would eventually

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.340
run out of milk, fourteen billion years later?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.340
Well... maybe.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.750
If you're playing pool or snooker or whatever
and you hit the ball at a certain angle at

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.200
a certain speed, if you have a good enough
computer you could say exactly where the balls

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.640
are going to go, right?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.370
It's all predetermined.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.130
If you took exactly the same shot a thousand
times the balls would do the same thing a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.170
thousand times.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.831
Well, if the big bang happened a thousand
times over just the way it did 14 billion

00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:13.069
years would you run out of milk a thousand
times 14 billion years later?

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.030
And doesn't that mean you entire life is already
determined, like the date of your birth and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.080
death was already predicted the moment the
universe came into being and everything has

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.010
to happen in a certain order, just that way,
just like a pool game?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.660
No, definitely not.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.190
We've got free will, right?

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.290
I mean, just because the universe is made
of atoms bumping into each other that have

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.849
to act in a certain way based on what happened
before and just because your brain is made

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.959
of atoms that have to do the same thing and
it's all part of the same system, you can

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.930
still just decide to do stuff, right?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.000
 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.069
 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.230
Because otherwise we're just balls in a cosmic
game of pool with no free will at all...meaning

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.629
we're just robots caught in a deterministic
system with just an illusion of choice but

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.230
really having no control whatsoever over our
own lives deluding ourselves into thinking

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.700
we're somehow different to all the other atoms
in the universe and that would mean you've

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.670
never made a real choice and you never will
and whatever you decide to do next in life

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.829
isn't a decision at all but was always going
to happen and there's no point to ever doing

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.239
anything ever again because everything was
predecided at the beginning of time and life

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.260
is completely meaningless and empty and â€“ fuck it 
black coffee is fine.
