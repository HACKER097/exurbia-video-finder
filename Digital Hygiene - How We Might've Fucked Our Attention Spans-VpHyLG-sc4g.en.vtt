00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Most of us have fucked our attention spans,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.200
I reckon

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.720
and I'm going to suggest a remedy.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.940
Like me, until recently, you may find that while you planned to have a productive Saturday,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.800
you instead spent it on

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.380
Youtube,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.320
and Facebook,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.580
and Agar.io,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.740
and ï»¿o t h e r  s i t e s,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.860
and got nothing done.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.160
WHY?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.300
Well, it's because the internet is absurdly addictive, and can cater to anything,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.180
ANYTHING,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.180
you want to see.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.360
And that's wonderful.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.120
However...

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.740
At the advanced, practically terminal age of twenty-seven,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.620
I remember a time when the internet was a luxury.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.060
And if you were on the internet, friends couldn't phone your house, so you used it sparingly.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.200
People in chatrooms were polite, (usually), even the creepy old men, because it felt like you were part of some new frontier

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.000
that was going to change the world.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.360
The Net was a tool back then that you usually only turned on to do something specific with

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.200
and it was, amazing.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.380
Now, the Net is incredibly sophisticated, and you can do bloody anything with it.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.680
However, this also came with a downside that looked like an upside.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.000
Which is that most of us are permanently connected to it, via our phones.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.460
Just as I am guilty of, you may find that in the morning, before even brushing your teeth, or making a cup of coffee, you check your e-mails.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.620
And if you think about it, that's kind of fucking crazy.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.500
You may have also noticed,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.880
again, like me,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.380
that reading books, or listening to a whole album, or just trying to learning a new skill that doesn't involve a screen,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.360
is substantially more difficult than it used to be.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.580
And half way through, you just give up and check Reddit,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.080
over,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.580
and over,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.340
for no good reason.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160
(shoutout to /r/accidentalrenaissance)

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.720
So here's my baseless conjecture.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.620
I reckon the Net, and phones in general, have seriously diminished human attention spans,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.520
to the point where we now expect almost immediate gratification for performing tasks.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.440
And when a book gets a bit boring, as they usually do,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.980
or playing an instrument is tough, or we get stuck alone with our own thoughts,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.600
...god forbid...

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.460
we switch to doing something mediocre online rather than persevering with something difficult in the real world.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.040
That is un-good.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.960
So, around a month ago, I thought,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.060
"Well, this is jolly silly,"

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.320
and set some ground rules.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.240
For the next month, I'd spend an hour in the morning answering e-mails, quickly check the news, check my life online,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.660
(because that is my job)

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.160
but then I'd just unplug the router for the rest of the day.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.620
And I didn't plug it back in until the next morning.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.800
I went and bought a load of books I've been meaning to read for ages,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.720
made an effort to go see friends in the evening,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.700
and every Saturday or so I'd go back through my subscriptions and have a watch of Youtubers I was really into.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.640
And the internet began to feel like a treat again.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.100
For the first day, or two, it was a bit weird,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.820
and I could feel there was a kind of instinct to reach for my laptop everytime I felt bored.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.480
But soon enough your brain works out that there's no point, because it knows it's:

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.480
No Wifi o'clock motherfucker!

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.200
And sure enough, tasks requiring concentration get easier, because you learn that you can't just escape into the lovely, fuzzy, warm oblivion of the internet.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.760
And on top of that, you realize, or I certainly did, that for a very long time now, you've been sacrificing productive time,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.140
or just an hour to have a think about your life,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.280
for the sake of watching something you don't really give a shit about, out of fear of being bored.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.640
Fast food is delicious, but you're not supposed to eat it for *every fucking meal*!

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.740
If you'd'te describe the internet to anyone before the nineties, they would have assumed we'd be living in a techno-utopia, and that everything would be amazing.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.780
And like all technology, they probably wouldn't have predicted,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.120
that this big lovely binary cake comes with some downsides.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.040
Now we have two personas to manage, our real one, and our digital one.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.960
Snail mail has been replaced with digital mail,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.960
(which people get angry with if you don't answer immediately),

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.900
and instantaneous transfer of information has given rise to immediate boredom with anything that doesn't have a hook in the first ten seconds.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.780
Try it.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.380
For a month, or just a week, use the internet as a tool again, rather than a source of constant gratification, if that's what you're doing now.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.440
Set some rules. If you work from home, download a site blocker.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.220
Take up a hobby in the outside world that you've always wanted to.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.920
Start watercolour painting!  (Pinky promise, it's worth it)

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.320
More than that, there's probably something you've always wanted to get into, or a project you've always wanted to finish.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.820
Why not do it now?

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.440
You'd be amazed what you can concentrate on when you're suddenly not obliged to check what everyone's been having for lunch that day,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.500
or what certain presidents have been tweeting recently.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.540
It's a bit worrying if this is a growing trend.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.320
I know people who can't sit through movies without playing Candy Crush or checking Twitter.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.920
Games, and the Net, are only going to get more alluring as time goes on.  The problem isn't going away.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.560
We're getting extremely good at hijacking the reward centers of human brains.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.640
Combine that with virtual reality, or whatever's coming next, and that is a kind of scary prospect.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.420
In the same way that you wash your hands after using the toilet,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.140
*HOPEFULLY*

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:35.140
we might one day start teaching digital hygiene, where we all learn to keep our concentration on one thing at a time, rather than running 10,000 tabs all at once,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.900
ALL OF WHICH ARE CATS

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.480
So, for a month, I dare you to step back from the Net, and go after whatever it is that you've always wanted to do in real life, but couldn't find the time.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.440
Read some books, learn to bake,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.180
get your camel riding license,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.820
whatever.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.240
Attention is a resource, and we only have a limited supply,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.280
and it's silly to spend that resource on things that may temporarily stop us from being bored, but don't really provide any mental nourishment.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.340
...Much like my Youtube content!

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.000
Bye
