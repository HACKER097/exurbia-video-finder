00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.600
Alright, so there's a kid out with his dad one day in the forest,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.200
and the kid says: "Why are the leaves green?"

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.320
And his dad, who's a botanist or a tree-surgeon or something, says:

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.760
"Well, because of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is green, and the leaves have chlorophyll in them."

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.160
And the kid says: "uh-huh".

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.220
And they walk a little more, and the kid says:

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.720
"But why is chlorophyll green?"

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.720
And the father says: "Uhh, well, light bounces off of things differently sometimes,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.620
and if chlorophyll is a certain density, blah blah blah or something...

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.820
...so it's green."

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.860
The kid says: "Okay..."

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.240
And they walk a bit more, and the kid says: "But why does light work like that, then?"

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.760
And the dad says, "Jesus Christ, uh... Because that's how physics works."

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.780
And the kid says: "But why does physics work like that?"

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.820
And the dad says...

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.340
"Because that's how the universe was set up thirteen billion years ago

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.220
when time and space began, alright, Aristotle?!

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.460
Leave it alone already – here, have a sandwich, shut up."

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.940
And the kid eats his sandwich, and he looks about a bit.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.840
And they walk a bit more, and the sun's going down.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.540
And they're heading back for the car, and the kid says:

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.840
"Then why did time and space begin?"

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.540
And that is a pretty good question.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.760
Everything has a beginning, however weird or wonderful.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.580
There weren't always planets, or stars, or galaxies, everything had to come from something...

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.520
...didn't it?

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.340
Well, sure it did.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.000
13 billion years ago, we're told, the universe just appeared, and it was very simple –

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.220
just atoms, and then molecules, and chemistry and stars,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.980
and then planets, and then ecosystems,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.640
and then curious sons and irritated fathers quite a bit later, but...

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.220
How did it all start?

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.660
There's two answers here, aren't there.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.640
See, everything either came out of nothing, for no reason at all,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.820
Or everything has always been around, well... forever.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.720
And both options are absolutely mental,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.020
and one of them has to be true.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.780
Other options that will not win the cash prize include:

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300
1. "God did it."

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.800
Yeah, well, then what did God?

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.300
2. "I don't care."

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.860
Yes you do, the stuff you're made of is 13 billions years old too – you should give a damn; or,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.720
3. "Maybe we're just too stupid to work it out."

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.540
Which is what everyone says shortly before someone works something out.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.900
So, everything came from nothing, or everything has always been around.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.760
Well, which one makes more sense?

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.540
Okay then... Let's say everything came from nothing.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.900
So, there's nothing, and for no reason at all, the universe just...

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.260
well, appeared.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.400
Well, weird stuff happens in the world all the time, for apparently no reason –

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.800
why can't the universe have just come around like that, too?

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.980
Well, it's different – see,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.400
when you get a free tax rebate or someone crashes into you at a junction, it might SEEM random, but there IS a cause.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400
It's just so complicated that you can't fathom it.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.700
One thing follows another –

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.460
and another, and another, and another, and another – and then whatever happens, happens.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.060
So, what does that have to do with everything coming from nothing?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.600
Well, if there's nothing... there's nothing.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.580
Nothing can't cause anything.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.020
Everything in the world that happens is because of atoms bumping into other atoms –

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.860
well, actually, they never touch, but that's a story for another time –

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.720
and fields interacting with other fields.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.500
Nothing doesn't have atoms or fields.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.740
It's nothing.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.000
So what then?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.440
There's black, and more black – not even black, actually – just... nothing,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.440
and then, for no reason at all, there's something.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.580
No cause, no anything, no rhyme or reason – just pop, and out comes the universe.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.260
But that's mad. NOTHING can be without a cause.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360
Well... here are some fun ideas, then.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.300
1) Time is drunk.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.160
What if time can double back on itself?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.140
What if the universe was caused... from its own future?

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.700
There's still a cause, there's still an effect – it's just that the Bang came first,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.440
and then the cause caused it much later – maybe at the end of time.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.180
But that's mental – nothing can go backwards in time...

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.980
...can it?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.880
If you could kill your own grandfather – paradoxes, etc, etc, etc...

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.760
Maybe. Modern physics might allow for it.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.580
Universe might not care about time going backwards, as long as everything matches up.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.520
If someone leaves a winning lottery ticket on your doorstep, and you win the lottery, go back in time,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.520
and leave it on your own doorstep to do it again...

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.840
What's wrong with that?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.360
As long as you don't change anything – everything is conserved, all the i's are dotted, t's are crossed.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.620
No paradoxes, no problem.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.620
2) Nature likes stuff.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.760
What if a property of nothing is that it makes... some things?

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.720
What if, just like the way gas expands to fill a room, or goldfish grow relative to the size of the tank,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.620
nature fills nothing with stuff?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.900
Because that's a quality that nothingness has – that's its character.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.800
Now, this is an interesting one – we'll talk about it in another video.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.900
But this has some insane consequences for the rest of the universe as well.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.480
3) Everything has been around forever.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.720
And ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever-

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.600
Let's put us here, and the Big Bang in here, and whatever came before it – here,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.760
and before that – here... and here, and here, and here, and here,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.720
and you just keep going forever – backwards, forwards, whatever –

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.680
time never ends, and it never began.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.360
Is that even possible?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.560
Maybe.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.120
Mathematics allows for infinities, but we don't see infinities in nature.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.140
But equally well, nature has turned out to be completely insane before, so why not again?

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.420
What if something has always been here?

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.800
Is it possible even to wrap your mind around that, without dosing yourself with high-grade LSD first?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.880
How can something not have a beginning?

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.820
Well, what if it's a loop?

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.620
What if time just bends back on itself again, and again, and again,

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.780
and everything has already happened – this video, waking up this morning, your birth, marriage, death –

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.780
all of it in exactly the same fashion –

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.300
and not just a few thousand times, not just a few million, but infinitely –

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.900
already, and will carry on infinitely?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.180
Well, moral of the story there is "don't screw anything up", because if you do,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.460
you'll be screwing it up literally for the rest of time.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.560
Forever, over and over.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.560
No pressure.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.800
Who cares?

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.520
Well, reasonable question, though rather rudely put.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.680
YOU should.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.500
This isn't meaning of life stuff, this is meaning of EVERYTHING stuff –

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.880
of you, of the Earth, of everyone on it, of everything outside of it. This is how we got here.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.960
If it turns out nothingness can make universes – well, that completely destroys our underlying understanding of the world.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.280
If it turns out that the Universe is an infinite loop – creating itself, dying, creating itself again –

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.280
well, that means we don't understand time yet.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.060
And that, in a way, we're all kind of infinite, living forever over and over.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.220
And, if it turns out that the universe made itself from its own future,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.160
well then, that's absolutely mental, and time can screw up just like you can,

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.580
so you shouldn't feel bad about your mistakes, because even the universe is drunk on the job.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.440
Isn't this the most profound question we could ask?

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.760
Not "why are we here", or "is there a God", or "what is consciousness", but "how did ANYTHING get here?"

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.420
Why is it this shape? And why is there so much of it? And why is it set up like this?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.800
Has it happened before?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.380
Will it happen again?

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.000
Is everything we know wrong?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Because right now we don't have a clue.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.380
Not scientists, not philosophers, not theologians.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.160
We don't even know where to start.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.640
And that... seems like the perfect place to begin.
