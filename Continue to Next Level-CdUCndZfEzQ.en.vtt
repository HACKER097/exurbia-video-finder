00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.969
We are rather clever little machines.

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.210
If you throw in enough food and leave us a
while eventually you get language, the printing

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.610
press, moon landings, instant mash potato,
and Debbie Does Dallas

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.420
This is thanks to a nifty piece of hardware
called brain.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.639
It weighs about 5 percent of your body but
takes in 20 percent of your calories.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.280
Anyway, there is a problem.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.770
The software keeps getting updated every few
years thanks to culture, but the hardware

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.520
is exactly the same as it was back when we
were savages.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.910
Upgrades to the human CPU take about a few
hundred thousand years even for small bug

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.730
fixes because evolution is very very slow.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.120
But these restrictions might all be about to change in
our lifetime and here’s why.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.120
Quick version:

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.120
This is Ray Kurzweil.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.120
He's a smart guy.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.100
He's invented lots of stuff you've probably
used yourself, and has written a bunch of books.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.490
Now, he thinks human technology is getting
better exponentially.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.840
That means it's not getting better year by
year, it's doubling at how much better it's

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.150
getting as it goes on.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.320
So, if it keeps up at this rate he thinks, this century, we're
going to get to a thing called the singularity.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.660
It's a word borrowed from physics and it basically
means that there will be a point when technology

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.690
is improving so fast, you can't even begin
to imagine what the near future will look

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.690
like.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.690
Rational Minibreak:

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.360
Before we get deeper into this, let's just
admit that if there's one thing we're worse

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.790
at than not murdering each other it's predicting
the future.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.170
If you told a victorian that in about 100
years we'd all have this communications thing

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.470
in our pockets that gives you access to all
human knowledge they might've said “Flaming

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.430
tallywags, tell what do you use it for?”

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.620
And if you're going to answer honestly, you'll
say porn and cats.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.490
And quite a lot more porn than cats.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.310
In other words, we always expect utopia is
coming and what we usually get is smarter

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.100
ways to do stupid stuff we've always been
doing.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.610
Anyway, let's imagine Ray Kurzweil is right
and the singularity has happened.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.850
Technology is improving so quickly we can't
keep up with it.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.320
What does the world look like?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.140
Well, maybe we can answer that with an acronym:
GRAIN.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.070
This stands for genetics, robotics, AI, and
nanotechnology, and even if only one of these

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.960
really takes off, that might mean the end of humanity
as we know it.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.540
So, for example if genetics gets pretty good,
we're might start redesigning humans.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.360
That means possibly removing stuff like mental
illness, designer babies or splitting into

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.360
thousands of different species of humans.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.210
It may've already started.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.570
There's a very strange new technique called
Crispr which means we might soon starting

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.880
editing the genes of human embryos.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.680
Please go and watch Kurzgesagt's video  for a good explanation.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.439
Or there’s robotics, which could revolutionise
agriculture, and again humans.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.439
O

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:12.439
Hey there.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.439
Having trouble lifting stuff?

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.790
Yeah, I am actually.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.040
How about robot arms?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040
Pretty cool eh?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.040
Yeah, amazing!

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.040
Thanks!

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040
And those legs look a bit tired.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040
Need an upgrade?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.730
Oh, yes please.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.140
Abracadabra, robot legs.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.959
Wow, that's awesome!

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.180
And are you tired of those silly biological
genitals?

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.180
What?

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.780
No, I like my genitals.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.980
Please don't touch my genit

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.079
We can cut that little fella off in a second.

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.650
Hey presto, robot schlong

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.319
Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhh

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.340
Or artificial intelligence might get big,
but I think we all know how that one might

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.650
pan out if it goes tits up.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.310
Or nanotechnology.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.760
Nanobots are little microscopic robots that
hopefully will perform all sorts of complicated

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.609
tasks and make copies of themselves.

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.970
Just a quick doomsday scenario for you, say
you make two nanobots, obviously they make

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.150
four in no time, then eight, then sixteen,
thirty two, sixty four, one hundred twenty

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.629
eight, until you could convert the entire
planet into nanomachines by the end of the

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:06.629
week.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.349
And possibly, like, the universe a bit later?

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.049
So GRAIN, that’s the acronym to remember
and it might mean the end of the world as

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.059
we know it.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.949
Some of these technologies are coming and
we’re going to put them in our bodies.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.319
And if that happens to a large extent, are
we human?

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.319
Or are we dancer

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.940
This the neocortex cortex.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.999
It seems to be the main part of the brain
that separates us from the rest of the mammals

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.699
as we have such a large one and it allows us
to reason in an abstract way.

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.489
Some people think what we’re doing with
our technology is kind of building another neocortex

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.999
but made of silicon.

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.579
We've already started outsourcing our brains
to our technology.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.019
When and IFFFF devices start being implanted
inside the brain, it isn't technology anymore,

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.969
it might be the next step in the evolution
of life itself.

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.379
And the humans using that technology won't
be humans anymore in the traditional sense.

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.669
We will have started on our journey up the
intelligence ladder to the next step in our

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.669
development.

00:03:52.669 --> 00:04:00.449
Or nothing might happen and the future will be incredibly boring. But that seems unlikely. All right, real talk for a minute.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.230
We're probably mostly wrong about what the
future will look like.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.230
We usually are.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.019
But if only 5% of this stuff happens , IF,
it will be bigger than the printing press,

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.049
than the internet, bigger than fire even. And
it might mean extinction or the birth of a

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.510
new species of human but one thing is for
sure. If it happens, we'll get to see the

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.160
beginning of it at least.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.840
We might already be watching it without realising.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.700
There's no telling what we're going to turn
ourselves into but there's every reason to

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.720
think it's part of a natural process.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.740
Just because it's technology that we're going
to use to evolve this time, doesn't mean it

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.650
wasn't always going to happen.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.980
This might be how species develop in the universe,
first through biology, then through technology

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.080
and then something else entirely maybe.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.750
The future we live in today was unimaginable
to our ancestors but at least we're the same

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.080
species as them.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.791
Tomorrow's humans might be not be the same
species, and stranger than that, they might

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:49.900
look back on our situation with the same regard
we give to primates or even single celled life.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.310
life. Genetics, robotics, AI, and nanotechnology and whatever else we invent, might rewrite the rules of biology.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.340
Every step we've taken has been on the outside
so far, exploring our planet, exploring the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.340
universe.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.650
It’s different this time.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.970
This might be the first adventure that goes
inwards instead.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.120
But we have a lot of bosses to beat before
we can get to the next level.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.120
We’ve got doomsday weapons, deadly contagions,
possible climate catastrophe, political tensions

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.700
and god knows what else.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.500
But if we make it through all that, if we
turn into whatever new species we're going

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.540
to become, it's probably going to be incredible.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.100
Our descendants might one day look back on this
century and think how amazing it was that

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.740
considering how violent and stupid we were
sometimes, that we managed to do so much with so

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.810
little, and that in spite of all the odds
against us, we survived anyway and turned

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:44.200
into something better and wiser, whatever
that happens out to be.
