00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
I think I was about 21

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.400
when I lost

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.360
my mind

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.540
I was living in this house with my best friend and this couple

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.140
and the girl was cool but her boyfriend often had

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.000
red eyes

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.680
and the house always smelled really spicy when he came over

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.920
So, we'll call him

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.160
So, one night Sir Drugsalot said:

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.260
"Hey, I've got these

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.500
MARIJUANA

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.200
brownies, so let's try them, yeah?"

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.200
"Who made them and what's the dosage?"

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.700
I should've said, but didn't

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.700
And instead I said

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.780
So we ate these things and they tasted strong

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.340
Very strong indeed.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.800
I ate two because I had a medical condition back then called

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.880
"being a fucking idiot".

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.660
We planned an evening of Mario Kart and cake

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.500
And watching the Matrix and deciding we were living in a simulation, etc.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.000
But, around an hour in, Sir Drugsalord said he felt a bit unusual and was going to bed

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.960
"Sir Drugsalot"-I said-"You can't go to bed, you gave us these, silly"

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.140
And he said -"Yeah, but I didn't make them"

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600
"What?"- I said

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.120
"Yeah, someone gave them to me, at a party...

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.700
...in Birmingham"

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.340
"IN BIRMINGHAM?!"

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.020
we all yelled.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.740
"So, you don't know how strong these are?

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.800
These drugs from...

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.600
BIRMINGHAM?" *chaos at the door*

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.120
"It's fine" -he said.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.180
And I guess that was when hell began

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.560
because it started to fell a bit like, hmm...

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.560
ahh, you know that feeling when you're going up in a lift

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.360
but the lift is full of blue fire

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.740
and you're convinced no one ever loved you

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.720
and you can't remember hoW TO FUCKING BREATHE?!

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.040
*IMPENDING DOOM*

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.860
Yeah, so...

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.500
Yeah, is like that, really.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.580
Everyone else at this point went to bed, but I'm an insomniac

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.740
at least when I'm on

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.740
drug fueled existential journeys into the unconscious

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.600
anyways, so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.920
I laid down on the sofa

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.460
for a bit.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.520
I got the TV on finally and it was halfway through Texas Chainsaw Massacre

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.900
and I realized that I no longer had the dexterity to even change the channel

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.900
so I made the best of it, and just leant back

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.840
into whatever

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.080
was going to happen.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.160
To the sound of hysterical screaming and revving chainsaws

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200
I attempted to recede into myself

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.080
to that spot at the heart of the psyche

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.680
where the buddhists and hindus tell us

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680
all our inner contemptment springs from.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.680
And the quest took me down a river

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.580
curtained by glass vines

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.580
and geometries from other universes

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.780
where the circumference is nowhere and the center is everywhere.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.020
And there it was. Finally.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.500
Peace of mind. Waiting in the distance.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.740
And when I came to my peace of mind at last

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.300
there was a note there, instead

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.380
and the note read:

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.140
Speech, motor control, memory

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.840
it all went out the window.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.260
And as my mind fell apart like soggy bits of cake

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.820
I stopped trying to stay sane

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.880
and gave in.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.600
Dead relatives appeared before me

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.400
desperately trying to say something but unable to speak

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.660
I saw myself as an older man

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.700
then an old man

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.080
and then a dead man.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.180
I desperately looked for an "I" or "me" on the inside and found none

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.620
nothing to hold on to, just atoms pretending to be a person.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.640
And then finally, I was just a mind floating in space

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.900
There was no history, no future

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920
It had always been like that, I knew

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.880
I'd only been dreaming of being a human this whole time

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.220
something I did occasionally to stop from going mad

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.220
and now, I was alone, again.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.040
Back in the real universe, where the only physical constant

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.340
were unrelenting horror

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.720
and infinite nothing

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.700
in all directions.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960
It had no beginning.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.220
It had no end.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.520
I would spend an eternity like this.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.420
-said a voice

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.700
"Who's that?" -I said.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.500
"This is your sub-subconscious, look, just chill out

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.060
Since we have almost infinite time here

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.000
we're gonna spend some of it making sure you don't make such a dumb mistake again."

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.720
Plenty of information exists online about how much you should be taking of a certain substance

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.580
given your height, weight and experience.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.660
Don't be a silly sausage and gobble any old amount

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.840
It's your mind,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.680
be smart.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.040
If you must insist on taking mind-altering substances

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.520
make sure it's with people you trust

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.420
not bellends at a party or something

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.180
If you're of a skittish or neurotic disposition

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.700
hallucigens may not be for you

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.260
Nor may substances like cannabis

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.640
which in large doses, especially when eaten

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.960
mimic psychodelics anyway.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.560
How long do the effects usually last?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.060
Is it nine hours at this dose?

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.620
Well, then, if you're seven hours in

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.700
it's only another two hours if you're having a bad time.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.440
You will be normal again soon.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.880
Yes, the world is suddendly very confusing and even scary

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.160
but, to be honest, before you took whatever it was

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
the world was equally confusing and scary

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
you just had lots of time to get used to that version.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.540
Besides, this one will be gone soon anyway

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.720
Be cool. Everything's gonna be okay.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.540
Have a cup of tea,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.260
wait it out.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.820
Also, write to your mom, she misses you.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.360
And stop eating frozen chips out of the bag you freak!

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.300
"Thanks" -I said- "that was...

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.700
whoa that was great!

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.400
Won't be taking excessive amounts of substances again in a hurry, that's for sure."

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.760
"Yeah."

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.400
"So, umm...

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.320
how much longer... do we have... left here?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.840
About an eternity, right?"

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.940
"Yep."

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.360
"Just uhh...

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.640
just you and me?"

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.660
"Yesssss."

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.320
"You uh....

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.160
you wanna cuddle, a bit?"

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.820
"What?"

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.400
"Nothing!"

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.620
William Tell's awesome overture

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.640
Thanks for uploading Exurby :3

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.460
Also where is my mystery link?

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.460
I miss my mystery link :(

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.340
Oh it's already ending?

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.480
Enjoy your existential crisis!
