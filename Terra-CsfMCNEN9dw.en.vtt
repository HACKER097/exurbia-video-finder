00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.380
it was a Sunday a normal one and without
warning 15 huge saucers appeared from the clouds

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.100
and hovered above 15 capital
cities

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.200
no one went to work and everyone watched their television and waited to see what

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.400
would happen next

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.390
nothing happened next the saucers were
silent sitting on the air doing nothing

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.400
at all not even wobbling

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.270
not really we tried to say hello in
every language we knew in Swahili in

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.830
Spanish or Morse code and binary and
still the saucers were quiet on the

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.130
second day we flew drones up close and
found they were made of a metal we had

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.149
never seen before and hovered by a method so clever it may as well have been magic

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.269
by the third day a few of us were
getting cocky and got close enough to

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.179
take selfies and we shouted up through
megaphones sorry,

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.929
what are you doing here? and the saucers stayed silent sitting on the air

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.039
doing nothing at all not even wobbling
and finally without warning around dinner time

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.579
a great booming voice came over
the world and the saucers said

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.960
Terrr-rrraa. sorry, we said, come again?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.489
Terrr-rrraa ... Terra? we said and the saucers were
silent. terra thought the linguists: Latin

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.269
for Earth

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.469
maybe it's a greeting of some kind.
terror thought the religious: Roman goddess

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.909
maybe she's back and she's angry.
terror thought the militaries add an -ism to the

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.590
end and we've got a big problem

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.159
by the fourth day saucerism was a
world religion and some of us wore

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.759
little spaceships around our necks and
began building churches Britain hold a

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.119
referendum to see if the saucers should
leave or stay and the Prime Minister

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.259
resigned. by the fifth day we went back
to work and economies ticked over, the

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.799
world went on as normal except for the
15 huge saucers which were perfectly

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.420
silent, sitting on the air,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.380
doing nothing at all, not even wobbling,
not really. and on the sixth day the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.320
government's and monarchies had enough
and prime ministers and presidents and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.710
queens and despots came onto the lawns of
their palaces and offices and looked up

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.259
at the sources and said: what do you want?

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.490
why are you here? and the saucers said
nothing for a moment and then came the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.240
reply:

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.540
Terrr - rrraa,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.900
they said, terrr - rrraa. a global state of
emergency was declared. they're obviously

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.560
hostile, America said, we should build a
wall to keep the saucers out until we

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.150
figure out what this is all about.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.509
we disagree, replied Russia, we should annex them and then claim they were our

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.740
saucers all along.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.070
this is outrageous, Britain said, we frown
on violence of any kind.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.490
right, America said, but what if there is a
slim to impossible chance they might

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.050
have weapons of mass destruction?

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.710
we've changed our minds let's invade
immediately! now just calm down,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.890
norway said, there's no reason to be
violent maybe they're telepathic or

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.100
something we don't even know what their
intentions are. Norway is right,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.240
Russia said, we should use nuclear weapons!
what? that's literally the opposite of

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.020
what we just suggested! we agree with
Norway, Britain said. and us!

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.200
germany said. what the fuck is wrong with
you? norway said, there's no reason to be

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.110
violent yet we don't even know what
they're going to... well, we disagree,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.200
russia said, what are you going to do to
stop us? yeah, said France,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.170
what are you going to do about it? now
look, sweden said, this is all getting a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.830
bit tense

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.580
we don't need to do anything rash! so you
want a war as well, huh? Britain said.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.390
n-no, Sweden replied, we'll just be
quietly sitting over here until all this is

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.900
over.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.100
I say we get rid of Norway, France
whispered, then we fire on the saucers!

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.390
what's that? norway said. we were just
asking if anyone has seen Emily recently

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.959
don't bob haircuts look good on French
women? right...

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.610
norway said, so it's going to be like that,
is it? the war lasted just over five

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.890
minutes and ended in complete global
destruction

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.040
those that survived ceased by coming
radiation poisoning and a nuclear winter

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.610
descended on the world blocking out the
Sun. cities were former shadows of

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.450
themselves

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.049
nothing but rubble remained. and through
the rubble came the call of the wind and

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.459
cockroaches listened to the wind and
survived and busied about below and all the

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.160
while the saucers waited above sitting
on the air

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.630
doing nothing at all not even wobbling
not really and finally the great voice

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.560
came again

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.980
terrr - rrraa,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.989
it said, Terrr - rrraa, terr..ribly sorry to bother
you, our translation software is broken

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.120
could you point the way to Andromeda?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.790
hello.........?

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.790
helllloooo.......?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.030
they're awfully quiet, aren't they? Oh, they're
probably just shy..

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.610
hey, what was with all those explosions?
dunno maybe they were having a party..

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:18.769
yeah maybe maybe it was a party..
ohhh, we 've fucking done it again
