00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.700
I lived once on the ocean floor,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.140
All robot help and sliding doors,

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.080
And thought seldom of the shore.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.720
Until I received one night
A letter from my grandfather,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.800
And the letter read:
"Dear Empty Head,
Ye who dwell on ocean's bed,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.200
I send this by the cracked moon's light,
It likely be the last I write.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.380
I'll take soon flight
For a long journey's while
To the Ninth Isle,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.920
Remember me as I will you,
All tree houses and untied shoe,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.660
In hope someday we meet again,
Your distant kin, Sebastian."

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.280
But a farewell by letter is little better
Than no farewell at all, so on a young man's whim,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.600
For my grandfather, I set off in search of him...

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.520
I left by quiet my stately keep,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.640
The escape was easy, guards asleep,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.100
And wandered 'bout on tiptoe feet,
The tall glass halls and cold steel streets,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.640
And found, at last, an airlock,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.720
But for love or none
Could find no life suit or aqualung.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.500
So, deep breath then,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.660
I go to find Sebastian.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.680
Then airlock open,
And off into the freezing hug of the dark ocean,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.140
And struggling up, heart kicking like a drum then,
Limbs and lungs all done then,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.440
And the next thing I knew, I woke again.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.780
All gasping and flail, and wet as whales, 
And most pinned by wind
And water, a storm, ye, a storm,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.240
Hell's teeth, and I at the center.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.460
And I, swimming as though possessed,
And I, to die, and senses arrested,
And kick my legs in fit of fear

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.800
And knew no north from south or my mouth from my arse, as I rolled about in the water.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.080
But God, air, and true wind on my face,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.100
For I had not known such a thing
In all my remembering,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.800
And though I might well drown and sink true down to the ocean floor once more in but a minute's stem,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.680
For this moment, swirling in those salt eddies, I was a boy again.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.740
And stormy though the night was hung,
Beyond that storm, I knew, the Sun.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.880
Nay, but I was still at fate's behest, and had no interest in the valley of death,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.400
And by width and breadth did trial about a long while,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.240
And the water did carry me along and put my soul and breath asunder,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.000
So this is how it ends, the long going under.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.940
And with water in my mouth, goodnight.
Yes, give up air and everywhere,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.760
Yes, goodnight. I go to seek a water sleep.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.940
But fate was hard at play
And I woke again, this time day,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.400
The storm a year away
So far as the sky told that story,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.280
A beach whereupon the sea had spat me out like some dislikeable pip.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.500
And I alive and washed ashore with bones and balls all sore,
And what's more, there in the sky's maw

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.480
Was the moon in cracked spoils of dead rock,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.080
As though God Himself had struck it with his mighty Galactic co-

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.860
But nay, there a man approached along the sand and called to see if I was all right.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.240
And his face became familiar of a sudden.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.880
"Grandfather?" I said.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.880
"Err, no?" replied he with concerned eyes on me and continued,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.260
"Sir, whatever ordeal you've just been through
Has perhaps relieved the sense from you.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.740
May I ask your name?"

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.640
And though I did my best not to show it –
My name, I realized, I did not know it.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.700
And my companion helped me to my feet, led me down the beach,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.020
And I walked bent double,
Still reeling from the morning's trouble.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.280
Then said he, checking my memory,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.180
"And how old is your grandfather?"

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.620
Said I, "I don't recall at all. Perhaps you're right, I'm rattled slight from the ocean."

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.680
"Okay," he said, "then which island is it you're from?"

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.620
"I'm not from an island," I said.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.860
"I hail from beneath the sea and that great aquatic nursery.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.700
For I am but twenty-one years old,
And from youth's throws, I escaped the watery below
For one last hour with the man who taught me all I know."

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.240
And slow he said, "But you are too young. You shouldn't be above the water.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.020
Not until their one-hundredth year
Can nursery folk yet come up here."

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.580
I only avoided his chiding stare
And took great gulps of salt sea air.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.580
Finally he said, "I think it best we find this grandfather of yours and get you to safe keeping.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.900
No isle is distant, mind,
And I've a vehicle of my own design.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.120
Come along. We'll make it wherever together."

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.040
And he led me to some great balloon whereupon we got in,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.580
And though he touched no gauge or board,
The craft set off of its own accord.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.780
We were out over the water then, and I saw the stories were true, so these lands were an archipelago,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.900
many islands scattered higgledy here and there, and I shouted to the man,
"Are they a totality?"

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.180
"Nay," said he, "each is its own little principality,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.900
And just like your nursery, one lives on the isle fitting of their age –

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.080
As you were too, if the rules you actually obeyed."

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.180
And pointing then he shouted:
"There that land of birch and oak
Does house those juvenile century folk,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.560
And there that land with beach and pier
Suits those in their two hundredth year,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.240
The three hundreders are to the west,
The fourth prefer the forest best,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.460
And so on, I shan't recount them all,
We've not far to go and our time is small."

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.920
"Sir," I said, "with all these folk living so high on time's shelf,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.120
I wonder if I might ask you how old you are yourself?"

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.600
And he replied, "Let's say if there be a tree
That needs watering once a century,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.080
Then I have filled my watering can eight times so far."

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.540
I could not help but stare at this man who, ignoring his demeanor,
Appeared physically only five years my senior,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.080
And in perfect health, but had somehow, eventually, aged eight centuries.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.580
And before I could comment there appeared, upon the horizon,
Rising up skywards,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.139
Some needle wound
At least ten thousand feet 'bove ground.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.060
"Vishnu's arse!" I cried, "What is that?"

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.280
"A tower, whereby," he did reply,
"It kisses tongues the edge of sky,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.160
And if you were to reach its spire,
You'd see the breadth of space entire.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.540
It proves most convenient for ascending objects into orbit without need of fuel or speed.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.360
And though keep your eyes open yet," he mumbled slight,
And five seconds hence did see him right,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.620
For overhead and yonder yet
Were craft wide as twenty jumbo jets,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.100
Seemingly sitting there in the air by dare of whim.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.460
"Oh gods, you're all so clever!" I cried. "You built all of this?"

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.400
"Aye," he said. "Year to year ascended each
By hammer's knack and number's reach."

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.100
And quite a while we watched the scene,
His face sincere, then turned to me and said, "Young man,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.420
be honest, What is it you want with your grandfather? Really?

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.520
Are you so bold, you can't just let the old be old?"

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.720
"Nay," I said, "I wish to talk with he who by longevitys, like you, has endured the centuries.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.500
Besides he says he's going elsewhere and I'd like to follow him there.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.700
His letter said the Isle of nines If that's his ground That's where I'm bound.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.400
Actually, I wonder if I asked, dare you to get me there."

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.620
He was quiet a while, pokered face No smiles, and said

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.020
"so you think age leads to becoming some Great Sage do you?

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.020
Yes, I'll get you to your grandfather

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.740
But we'll take the scenic route on our way to the Isle of the nines"

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.140
"Fine," said I

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.440
our bearing changed then South was bound for some small spit of sandy ground

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.400
"I think," said he, "we'll search about and see if we can't out some of that wisdom you crave"

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.820
and before I could protest we'd set down and come ashore and were bounding over pier floor

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.620
and up then sand and jungle thick and Cut our way with will and stick and emerged before a town

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.160
in the suburbs folk were felling trees and hauling Shore great carts of iron ore

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.960
then further in were folk who looked as young as I and dancing 'Neath the broke moon sky

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.080
all necking bottles gin and beer then coupling up to disappear

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.060
which Isle is this, I asked my Friend. I'm barely two decades old they act younger yet.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.100
The Isle of ones said he all here have aged at least one century

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.840
He left me down the winding paths of open debauchery and open bars

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.900
and folk who clear appeared They slept perhaps three days a year

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.460
and we came upon a woman bare, all dancing legs and wild blonde hair

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.760
My friend proclaimed "Oh Lady mayor I've brought for thee one cub straight from the nursery

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.900
and he has questions for his elders"

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.520
She regarded me with red eyes and regard tireder yet and said "nursery, huh?

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.640
Why here we've ditched the milk, but kept the bottle, ask away young Aristotle"

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.900
and the music did stop and all folk turned about with their drunk Blair stares poking out

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.940
and the lady mayor of the Isle of ones did close her eyes in great profund

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.120
I murmured "why, I am young and confused about everything and sure of nothing

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.040
but above all I should like to know how does one live well?

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.100
And how does one see far?

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.620
and how does one want for nothing and still acquire everything?"

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.740
I leant sure close and cupped my ear, the wisdom of one in her 100 years

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.380
whereby she replied, "the secret to acquiring everything? Buy it

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.360
how to see far? Squint

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.640
and how to live well? Well

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.020
I'd suggest you found your answer here for we've loads of drugs and high strength beer!"

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.240
and though I cried out for Clarification it was surely the end of that conversation

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.600
and my new companion led me back past trees and Lagoon to our waiting bright balloon

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.760
"What," I said, with confusion fat, "the holy

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.840
Fucking shit was that?"

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.800
and off we left it over the beach up Once again into the wind's reach.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.740
"Look," he said, "True they're all one century

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:01.860
But since we live at least nine in these enlightened times they are but teenagers still. Aging is a relative thing

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.760
It wasn't long after life extension was perfected

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:11.300
We noticed that the older one dares to grow the more they prefer the company of those in years close to theirs They know

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:16.880
that is why each age lives on its own isle. You would have little of importance to say to a child

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.020
such is the gap ten times wider with us. So there it is."

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.320
I said, "'So there it is.' Why, my grandfather liked that phrase also."

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.440
"That may be," said he, "and yet your grandfather is not me."

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.840
And following his dead-end boon, I set eyes upon the fractured moon

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.840
I said, "Our pale lady of the night is not looking quite right

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.300
what happened to her?" "The Fall," he called. "Why, the world wasn't always such a peaceable place.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.720
We once used to play war to keep score."

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.400
"How does one blow up a moon?" "By being smart enough to build technology that can do so and

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.120
simultaneously stupid enough to use it.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.400
"Not too long from now, pieces of her will fall to the ground

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.940
and if any of us are still around by then, the air will turn deathly

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.420
and for sure no living thing will endure.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.440
Save for those living beneath the sea." "Like me," I said,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.640
"and what will everyone still above the sea do instead?"

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.880
He said "We've another destination in mind, where we might start over sensibly this time."

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.980
With a squint I call sight just slight of rising constructs in the far,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.820
spires and towers for a crown, sure the mark of a city or town.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.680
Said I, "Start over where? Over there?"

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.900
Said he, "Nay that is but the remains of nations

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.920
why sometimes on a new morning one can still make out the old world."

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:38.040
Said I "Well, who lives there?" "No one," he said, "Or the remains of the debt

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.180
the legacy of our forefathers, who'd rather blow up a moon than two teams agree on some tune

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:50.660
they might both peaceably dance to. To hell with them. For all our modern wonders, it's taken millennia to recover from their blunders.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.420
And from the smallest of corners of my mind's eye

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.720
I Saw and heard the bright sounds of those dead towns

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:03.340
the blaring horns and thousand forms of life to those days prior to whatever

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:09.280
fire they cast on themselves. Back before science had learned to stand in defiance of aging and death, and almost under his breath

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:18.360
My old companion said, "The cruel irony is that many folk from that barbaric time still survive today since aging technology went their way

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:24.560
yet the human brain can only contain so many memories and so as they've aged they've forgotten the truth

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.580
of what they did to our planet and moon in their youth

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.480
and though the Catastrophes live on in their name they have by quirk of dementia escaped the blame.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.440
What luck, what shame."

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.480
I said, "But you assume from the ruins that they knew what they were doing.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.780
Maybe they meant well with their inventions and broke the world in spite of their best intentions?

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:53.420
"Right," he said, "I'm sure in their empty heads when they poisoned the ocean and took their wars to the moon they were really doing it for love and big bright red balloons."

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.620
And he looked off from our basket a moment and said,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.280
"Sorry." Said I, "Don't apologize, why, all that anger in your eyes

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.220
makes me just then remember my grandfather's temper you so resemble him, see."

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.700
"That may be," said he, "and yet your grandfather is not me."

00:12:11.179 --> 00:12:17.900
And I glanced ahead to find we were coming down again, not in a forest this time but a town of some kind.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:23.960
Stark marble pillars and great mansions and villas and when we sat down a man came around and said,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.440
"Welcome friends, why, please enjoy your stay- if you're going to park on the beach, by the way,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.720
that'll be 20,000 shells." "Oh, add it to my tab," my companion said,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.320
and with my confusion stark, we pushed on into a park

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:42.040
at the base of each tree, a sign declared a fee of 10,000 shells for sitting in its shade.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.280
Likewise looking at the birds would cost the third of what one in a month, made.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.300
So too were their charges for drinking from the water fountains or stopping to marvel at the mountains.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.540
and we wandered down ostentatious and spacious streets,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:02.480
and found we'd meet with folk tired and thin walking hurried checking their devices greeting each other with declarations of stock prices

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.680
Then pass piles of shells in little Laos and even the dirt and ants have been valued with little price tags

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:14.980
And we found a great conch shell a man waited outside so thin I wondered if he might already have died

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:21.080
My companion said sir, Mayor Hello. The mayor replied. Yes. Have you come about my stock portfolio?

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:27.000
Ah, no, this is my friend from beneath the sea and if you've a moment, he has some questions for thee. Yes

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.760
I said I'd like to know of you. How does one live well, and how does one see far?

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.920
And how does one the mayor interrupted and how many shells will you pay me to answer these?

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.420
none admittedly I said but you do look a little hungry and if you like you can have this banana for free

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:49.700
he snatched it from Me at once and said, ah I see this will revolutionize the economy

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.580
I said they literally grow on trees for free,

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.980
but he was already off on some tirade about the banana trade

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.640
He yelled. Why by this time next week? I'll be a banana coin billionaire

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.320
My companion led me away said perhaps that's enough economics for today

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:11.640
And we fled the commotion past the starving, Rich masses to our balloon back over the ocean

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.220
My companion said when the ones twos and threes are bored of their parties

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.560
They move for a while to the aisles of the fours fives and sixes to pursue a game of riches

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:28.820
I said But they're all starving themselves. Yes. He said but look at all their pretty shells Eh, don't worry yourself

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.540
by the time they reach their 7th century. It becomes pretty evidentiary

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:37.380
There's more to the world than just wealth said I but what's the point in all this?

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.760
undying populations on little island nations Hosting parties heeding the markets call

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:48.500
while above each day The moon sidles closer to come crashing down and ending at all.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.360
Why my companion said

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.000
though It's easy to miss there is a point to all this

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.100
The ones twos and threes they party nightly Yes,

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:07.020
but by day they mind the metal and fell the trees we need for new technologies for spaceship walls and ceiling beams Exotic matter machines,

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.000
then the fours fives and sixes why they don't just pursue riches

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.740
by evening They take the felled trees and ore and ensure by the great space tether that it is all ascended into orbit then assembled together

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.340
into one great metal vessel

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.240
It is the most ambitious thing ever built from man's imagining

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.200
and not a few weeks from now 10 million of us

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:34.740
Will empty our drawers and lock our doors and kiss. Goodbye the Mountains and valleys and climb to that waiting galley

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:41.980
and once boarded each find ourselves afforded Four-poster cryogenic beds there to lay our heads for decades yet

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:47.520
and then in liquid nitrogen 10 liters deep 10 million souls in no dreams sleep

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.120
and each space support that isn't there to accommodate our frozen beds

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.900
will carry instead What's left of the past each species will ride with us

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:03.460
from cabbage tree to New zealand kauri every Evergreen and deciduous, cedar, to cork, to eucalyptus every genus and Venus flytrap

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.940
kept maintained by clockwork brains

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:13.240
And what's more pig, donkey, boar, fly, swan, Crustacean, Dalmatian, domestic Or wild we've every gene on Petri filed.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.840
hell Neanderthals and early man too

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:22.010
and we fly. out beyond the broken moon a hard left past Jupiter. We wish him Goodbye

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.740
passing straight through the Oort cloud Turning about to enjoy the view

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.840
then setting sail on physics not so much in numbers indenture

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.820
But stolen from one of God's more surreal magic mushroom adventures

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.760
contracting space before our noses Expanding it beyond our asses

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.100
will show time and Einstein a thing or two

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.400
until we fly faster than Zeno's racing tortoise

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.060
or poor Swift Achilles who trailed then after and

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.880
and Roused again we'll find we have arrived on the doorstep of a new house

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.900
Gravity that of earth and with an Earth's worth already of forests, and seas, and lakes, and trees

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.520
and in the midday sky We'll find not one Sun as we had before

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.040
but two in Circumbinary awe.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.220
and though we'll bring food and clothes and build schools and roads

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:12.120
and paint our mark on every damage of the thing So it one great living pearl among 10,000 dead world's

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.220
not a gram of our stupid past and smuggle itself down onto the ground

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.140
No Denial of what is in favor of what one wishes

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.100
no slinking off to watch TV and leaving some other poor bastard to do the dishes.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:27.720
science, truth, art, objectivity, universal human regard

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.100
then finally the death of war and ignorance

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:38.240
and that Infernal library of excuses for I, me, my while you still lie in the gutter and starve and die

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.120
We will build a world untainted by selfish bastards where we'll be free range humans at last

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.060
and do whatever we fucking like all day and lay great brilliant eggs of knowledge and wisdom

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.980
and live under two suns at The expense of no one

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.880
finally out under the above for love for love

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.080
That is the night Isle and we set off and not a week's while

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.140
for our species. Try a one last. Pardon

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.440
We are going alone together

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.340
back to the garden

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:18.560
Ah Said me, sounds swell and what about those of us in the nursery do we get to come as well.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.660
that's complicated. He said

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.540
we approached at last over a new isle of yet another style

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.120
My companion said to me why it seems you and I are at the end of our journey

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.940
the Isle of the eights For almost the century that has been the land upon where I lay my hat

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:42.520
Over we passed I peeked in through the glass of the windows all wide and saw books stacked as towers and folk reading inside

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.280
What do they do? I said they and you

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.780
Said he I told you of the soon trip to our new home

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.180
and though we have solved much of the perils of travels in Space

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.600
there is but one more problem we faced on

00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:01.200
our journey We want to take with us every film and thesis every book and treatise the mulch of every culture

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.800
But not even the moon would have enough room to store those works physically

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.240
and digitally If we were to store it That way

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.300
cosmic rays would see wipe it right out in but a few hundred days mid-flight

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.799
and so we found a method Yes a fur

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:15.220
Human brains

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:22.140
each seven and eight like me commits to their memory some chosen book or speech to preserve until we reach the new house

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:27.180
We learn to remember to not forget I said and which work lives in your head

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.100
said he prose and poetry Eighteenth to 23rd century

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.980
for like you I once had a grandfather who showed me the world in a manner I could understand

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:41.760
Back when the old world was still new and so was I I'd sit on his knee and he'd reached me long into the evening

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:49.100
of fiction and farce or whatever I asked and for all those stories absurd they gave me a passion for the percussion of words and

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.060
That's how I knew what it was. I'd remember

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.540
I said and your grandfather now is he Yet still alive?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.260
but our basket sat down then at last we'd arrived.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.780
we Disembarked single file on another new Beach on another new Isle

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:10.240
nay. I said wait, I remember this land aye, he said it's the same from the one we began

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:16.720
and then standing not feet from our great steed balloon was a woman there Staring at the dead fractured moon

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:22.960
the woman called out why what a fair moon this evening aged So it's the exudes a vital glow

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.220
she turned on me said though true the same cannot be said for you

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.520
Well, no I said since I am not aged so

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.860
my companion bowed his head said nothing Oh ye

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.360
she said what the centuries have done to your memory.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.040
I replied you must be mistaken I am from the nursery

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:47.120
said she there is nursing there certainly, but for those so aged they cannot nurse themselves

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.400
I am the matron of the nursing dome and I am here to take you home

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.540
by choice Will you come back with me or need I summon armed security

00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:00.460
now Look I said I am 20 or 21 rather and I have come to find my grandfather

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:07.500
So why she said yet? You walk hunched and move slow such would we expect of one born a millennium ago?

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:15.500
What said I and raised a hand to my eyes and found the skin was cracked and cold or one might venture old

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.800
She said how to put it Well, oh, yes Your generation is the reason the fall fell

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.820
all greed and in need of speed and more patting yourselves on the back for progress

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.980
Meanwhile, leaving every garden unweeded and all who fell behind unfed then dead

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.720
You have been honorably discharged of being dishonorably in charge

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.240
and while we aren't as cruel as to have you all put down We sure Shant opt for having you around

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.260
and so you are most welcome to the ocean floor where you shan't ruin the world Yet more.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.820
Yeh beneath the sea there are jigsaw puzzles and rocking chairs that wait again for thee next time

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:55.680
We'll be sure to lock the doors. I am taking you back to the seabed once more

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:03.700
to the matron My companion said why I'm sorry. I took him on a tour of the land I only hoped he'd remember or at least understand

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.060
but before you bring him home might for five minutes you leave us alone

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.940
Rose a skeptical eyebrow on her skeptical face though. She nodded and plodded off some while away

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:20.460
Oh gods, I cried and closed my eyes to my companion I said this is the dementia you mentioned.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:27.720
Yes he said I thought maybe with an hour or two it would come back to you and you'd return to the nursing dome on your

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.660
Own it's time for you to go home if there's anything I can do for you

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.920
Yes You can said I let me lie here for the rest of my days

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.020
above the water in some semblance of a dignified way

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:43.720
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. He said I wish you luck in all hence.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.860
I said don't apologize There's no taken offense

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.540
Why in a day or two I suppose I'll remember neither the beach nor you

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.580
Thank you for my big day out.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.400
We hugged them in the awkward male fashion two loose grips and a little back tapping

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.820
He turned about bound inland bound starwort.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:06.700
No great elation. No great despair I simply gulped the salt sea air

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.200
and wondered then if I would ever breathe it again

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.860
My companion paused and turned about let out they gave me an early warning

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.960
the nursing dome I mean when you made your great escape

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.520
Gave me time to reach the beach and wait in hope you'd rise alive from the waters

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.900
And so you did and so I found you

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.860
Early warning why I said What're you to me or I to thee

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.480
he said my grandfather was never the sort to go quietly Once caught

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.980
said I that may be and yet your grandfather is not me

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.120
said he

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.780
but you are

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.980
Have you been so by time defiled? You don't recall your own grandchild?

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.000
It was I who sent a letter hoping for the better you'd recall who I was

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.080
and though you remembered me fine You mixed me up in time. I did not want to leave you down here without one last try Oh, goodbye

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.340
I didn't know for my sake you'd stage a fucking Prison Break. I only meant to say goodbye

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.220
Well I said then hello

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.340
Oh God I remember

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.040
between the fields and owls and Shrike long hours teaching you how to ride a bike.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.120
Yes He said yes said me

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:21.140
I remember year upon my knee and from the elm tree sat ten starlings deep and I'd read to you till you fell asleep

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.160
Yeah, he said

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.340
and the alphabet and cigarettes and Ethernet and tape cassettes

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.320
it was the old world and I think of it every day and I think of you on the sea bed every day

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.360
and because Ruin the world or not You are my grandfather and I am your blood

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:40.360
and while you may not remember those Kindnesses you did me when I was little I do and I will remember for both of us

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.240
And if one day I have children, I will tell them of you

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.720
So they even when I am gone your kindnesses will thread on down the hooks of your descendants

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.580
And then your kindnesses will never die

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.940
And when both of us are gone when we're only stories it will still live on

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:59.820
until there and all the time and space snuff To dust and dust enough. There'll be two facts lying leftover in dead eternity

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.580
that You are my grandfather and I loved you

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:09.380
and I cannot spend another week worrying that alone and decrepit beneath the sea sits you while I won't soft as Xanadu

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:15.540
even if I make it to the edge of space over the threshold We'll still be there your old sad face

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:21.980
I said yet all the while you are still bound for the ninth Isle and I for jigsaws and sliding doors

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.540
I just hope you recall me in good stead

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.380
he replied then you may wish of me the same tomorrow for I am staying right beside your empty head

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.100
and I Protested but you set off for the Stars in not a week You said

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.880
Rockets be damned said my grandson one day they'll build another. It's what humans do

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.820
but grandfathers are a one-time Construction and these may be my last days with you.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:49.720
Let's run back to the old world. Let's find the tree ten starlings deep and I'll read you till you fall asleep

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.560
and if little pieces of yesterday come back to you Whenever

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.200
then tell me and we'll remember them together

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.600
and back down the beach back to the balloon We're off on the wind then and under the moon

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.980
at lasts borne back ceaselessly into the past

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.920
And from our basket Sebastian yelled with all his might.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.360
Hey matron go fuck yourself big kiss. Good night

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:16.440
The new world pulled away behind and on some perfect fever dreams frontier the old world drew near

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.780
something Waited and though dead for sure it waited to receive us once More

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:27.880
and my grandson began to shout the poems would known from the tomes we'd owned and the lines came back easily even to me

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.620
We remembered we remembered together.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.560
Let us go then you and I he yelled when the evening is spread out against the sky I replied

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:41.300
like a patient etherized upon a table Let us go through certain half-deserted streets the muttering retreats

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.560
of restless nights and one night cheap hotels and Sawdust restaurants with oysters

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:52.640
about about in reel and route the deaf fires Danced at night the water like a witch's oils burned green and blue and white

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:59.660
and summoned dreams Assured world the spirit that plagued us so nine fathom deep here followed us from the land of mist and snow

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:08.280
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree where alph the sacred River ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:17.700
So twice five miles of fertile ground with walls and towers were girth round and there were Gardens bright with sinuous rills Where blossomed many an incense bearing trees and he were forest

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.060
(V.O fades out)
