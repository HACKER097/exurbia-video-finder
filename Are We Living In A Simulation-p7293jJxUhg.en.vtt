00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.420
We're all down with asking what if we're living in a video game without realizing,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.140
and "I think therefore I am" and shit, but there's actually quite a good argument for it.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.460
The Swedish Philosopher Nick Bostrom has this thing called "the Simulation Argument", and it's actually sort of compelling.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.240
All right, so let's imagine life is a pretty common phenomenon in the universe because,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.100
c'mon, it probably is; stuff has been around for at least 13 billion years. Even if life is relatively rare,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.360
that's a lot of time to do something rare a few times over at least.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.220
Then, let's imagine some of those civilizations are technological,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.820
And sometimes they get to this thing called being post-human (or post wookie)

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.240
where they've got these insanely fast computers that can run consciousness on them.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.020
So, they might run these things called "ancestor simulations" where they model their ancestors on a computer and run it,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.640
and if you were in one of these programs, the simulation will be so convincing,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.480
you just wouldn't know the difference between the real world and the simulation.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.020
So, one of these statements has to be true, according to Nick Bostrom:

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.980
1) Hardly any civilizations actually get to a post-human level.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.060
Maybe, they blow themselves up first or discover tvtropes.com or something.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.060
2) They DO get to a post human level, but they don't give a crap about running ancestor simulations. Fair enough.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.420
Or 3) They DO run ancestor simulations,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.000
and that means we're probably living in one.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.240
Here's why:  if you had that much computing power, you could run millions of these simulations,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.520
maybe varying each one to see what would happen.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.560
So, there might only be a few million civilizations in the Galaxy,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.260
But if 1% of them are doing the ancestor simulation thing, that means there could be billions of ancestor simulations running right now,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.660
and that means potentially trillions of people living inside of them.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.980
So, it's far more likely you're living in an ancestor simulation than the actual universe.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.600
Yeah, but why would you run a simulation of people in 2013?

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.360
Well, if you ran it any later we might have the technology to start building our own ancestor simulations.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.220
Creating a sort of stacking effect where you've got simulations inside the simulations like a fucking Russian doll FROM HELL.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.840
...and that would just be plain confusing.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.500
What's kind of interesting is that even for these post-human gods running our simulation,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.480
they must have thought about this, too and concluded that they could be living in a simulation.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.420
And maybe whoever's running theirs have thought about it up-and-up. Never really reaching a point where you could be absolutely sure this was real reality.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.140
I mean

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.929
That's just never going away is it? However many levels up in the simulation chain you are,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.640
you're always going to get some douchebag philosopher ruining it for everyone.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.120
What little we do know about whoever is running the simulation is a bit sinister, really.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.580
They certainly don't seem to mind not stopping death in large numbers or suffering or political tyranny or terrible music,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.580
so they're certainly not all benevolent and flower-power.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.620
And that's concerning on a number of levels, unless it's just you in the simulation and everyone's an extra.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.460
But that's just plain horrible to think about.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.320
So... what now?

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.760
Nick Bostrom says that maybe we should take note of this and act accordingly. Like, if we [?] as a species,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.190
maybe whoever's running it will just get bored and turn it off. There's no reason to suspect their super moral or not super moral

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.120
I mean, we're pretty smart and still basically just territorial apes with nuclear warheads, so...

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.800
intelligence doesn't seem to correlate with the lack of interest in violence. So maybe they're just doing it for fun.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.060
Or if computers are powerful enough, maybe we could all just be sat on some kids PC

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.280
just one tab over from some feature incarnation of YouPorn and BBC news

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.500
Is there any way, then, that we would know we're in a simulation?

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.580
– actual evidence...

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.560
Maybe. If reality on a subatomic level turns out to be suspiciously computational looking, that might be a clue.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.960
Maybe we should modify our search for a Theory of Everything in Physics accordingly,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.600
or there might be glitches, but that seems kind of unlikely given that whoever's doing this must be pretty tech savvy by now.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.520
Besides, they could just [?] your memory if there's screw-ups anyway, so there's no reason you know about it.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.080
In case You're watching this, Computer Overlords...

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.140
I'm sorry about all the war and Robert Mugabe and the Twilight Saga and everything...

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.620
but we've been to the moon now!

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.920
And you can order pizza over the internet, so we're not doing too badly.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
All in all, the moral of the story, then, is live a reasonably interesting life –

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.080
ride a unicycle, learn crochet, write a book or something

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.320
– so you don't all get us turned off!
