00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020
A university is a collection of buildings where in exchange for all of your money, time, and dignity,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.900
you'll be rewarded with a clammy handshake,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.560
some paper with a special ribbon,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.760
and a lifetime of crippling social regret.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.060
Subjects might range anywhere from beekeeping to crack pipe engineering,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.360
but it is important to study something with integrity.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.000
And by integrity, I mean whichever course is the one disproportionately populated with hot people.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.180
If you remember anything at all from the first week of university, you're doing it wrong.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.640
This can be solved with alcohol.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.560
The typical student favorite is to mix in

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.720
three parts Bacardi,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.880
one part lighter fluid,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.140
and a sprinkle of parsley.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.500
We used to refer to this as,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.440
"The Neurologist."

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.560
Mainly because after drinking the thing, it became necessary to visit one.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.200
Students practice a number of hangover cures, though I can recommend Aspirin,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.700
two tablets should take care of a medium-sized hangover,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.260
100 tablets should take care of anything more severe

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.240
including any other problems you may happen to have in your life at the time.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.520
On your first day of lectures, you will meet your professors. It's their job to bend over backwards

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.860
to accommodate your belief that you know more than they do,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340
despite them having studied their entire lives for this job.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.560
"Yes," they all say,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.960
"Please tell me more about your groundbreaking idea for perpetual free energy.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.840
As a physics professor, the concept is completely new to me and I'm sure a delinquent,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.560
and frankly dubious smelling 18 year old is about to disprove the entire history

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200
of fucking thermodynamics."

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.880
Lectures will consist of many students all sleeping at once, in a large room, with a clever person talking at the front.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.840
Seminars will consist of much the same, but with only a few students sleeping as it's harder to get away with it.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.920
If you are startled awake by the professor, and the sentence ends in an,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.420
eh?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.440
You have probably just been asked a question.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.300
Do not panic.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.100
If it's an English lit or a philosophy seminar you're in, answer that frankly you found the text problematic and simplistic in places,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.720
wait for the applause to subside,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.100
then readjust your beret.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.020
If it's a maths or science subject,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.860
try launching yourself out the window,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.180
because you're probably fucked.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.520
You may find yourself sharing a prison block with Lovecraftian nightmare creatures,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.980
who use body odor as a primal defense mechanism.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.720
Welcome to Student Accommodation.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.020
In the coming years, you'll probably have the opportunity to move off campus.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.260
Friends who you generally knew from eating lunch together, or partying, will suddenly occupy the room next door.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.280
It will seem inconceivable, that someone so lovable only weeks before, is in fact,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.020
such a consummate filth wizard.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.680
No no, just like all the other objects in the house, plates are of course self-cleaning.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.560
Please continue to stack them up in the sink, like some kind of elaborate circus performance.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.440
Decency, what's that?

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.980
I simply love 'Rage Against the Machine' at 5:00 in the morning, top volume,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.480
accompanied by the deafening, and discordant melodies of frantic shagging.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.100
Most universities sport a number of recreational establishments nearby.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.520
Many of the local discotheques will encourage standing epileptic fits to loud music,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.700
and consumption of large quantities of alcohol.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.420
If that doesn't sound like your thing, the library is usually open 24 hours

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.920
and they're happy for you to do acid in the archive room.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.720
As long as you don't tell them you're doing acid in the archive room.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.600
In your final year, you may be expected to write a thesis.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.720
The first draft should be finished several months in advance of the deadline;

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.060
though it can be begun and completed the night before hand-in with access to strong enough methamphetamine.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.580
If you're doing university properly, you'll probably go into it thinking you already clued up about 80% of your subject.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.560
And you're here to learn the remaining 20%.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.320
By the middle year/years, you may realize you in fact know about 20%,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.760
and you have a short time left to learn the remaining 80%.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.760
And upon graduation, you'll now understand that you understand almost nothing about your field,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.540
and that there is an ocean of people more talented at and committed to it, than you.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.960
So that's nice and reassuring.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.120
Look...

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.720
it's got a special ribbon on it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.239
Paradoxically though,

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.040
graduating is perhaps the hardest part of being an undergraduate.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.600
The world is quite different outside of university.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.080
If you don't do stuff on time, you still get angry emails, but you also might find yourself unemployed,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.260
and possibly impoverished.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.740
Members of the general public often grow unreasonably annoyed if they notice you vomiting on their garden.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.040
And quite by surprise,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.720
you will notice you are now expected to be and quote,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.880
"Actual Person."

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.020
Unfortunately, this is in fact, the real, education period.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.540
You teach yourself, grade yourself, ultimately.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.080
And the only tuition fee is exactly one lifetime.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.220
Lectures begin when you wake up in the morning, and end when you go to sleep.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.040
And what you're supposed to be learning, is not at all obvious.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.840
Everyone else is also a student at Existence University.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.040
Some of them appear to be perpetually enrolled in a course called,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.260
"How to be a Total Cock Like All the Time."

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.560
Others are getting their Masters and PhD's in

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.820
"Just Being a Good Human"

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.860
and I humbly suggest you hang out with them.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.760
Deadlines will not be extended.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.500
Plagiarism will not be tolerated.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.920
The answers will not be found at the back of the book.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.060
In any case, the years after university are mainly for cultivating those qualities that may have been missing from your days as a student,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.780
namely,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.660
self-respect,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.640
personal hygiene,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.900
basic social skills,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.640
humility,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.340
and a tolerable personality.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.080
Or, if those don't sound appealing,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.620
why not make the most of that degree,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.700
and catastrophically disappoint your parents by becoming a YouTuber.
