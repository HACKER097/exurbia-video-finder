00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.920
So, you're worried about a thing, are you?

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.060
Might be a bill you can't pay, might be a job interview.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.580
Might be your career falling apart. Whatever.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.700
But the best thing you can do in this situation is just to think about it as much as possible.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.840
Don't do anything about it.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.700
Just make sure keep worrying because that always makes problems go away.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.900
Look at all those people.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.820
Whatever you're worrying about must be a million times worse than anything they can imagine.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.540
They've definitely never had to face a personal crisis.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.340
I'm sure they never felt lonely, been sued, lost family members, spouses, children.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.680
They probably never been fired, or been in love with someone who didn't love them back

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.780
or paniced about their career, or anything most humans go through in a lifetime.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.880
Because whatever you're worried about is definitely the biggest thing that has ever happened to anyone. Ever.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.820
No one has ever been to war so they wouldn't understand what you're going through.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960
They haven't approached Omaha Beach and known they are probably going to be dead in a few minutes.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.180
No one has ever been trapped in a damaged spacecraft, thousands of miles from the earth, running out of oxygen

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.700
No one has had to face constant bombing from the air that turned up without warning.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.360
Somehow whatever it is recently you've got on your mind, that justifies you loosing sleep.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.680
And being a total dick to yourself.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.080
Well, you know best. Luckily humans live forever and never age.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.220
So dont worry, you've got infinite time to hold yourself back with doubts.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.580
And actually it's worse than that.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.200
You know, if the bad thing does happen,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.980
where you dont get the job or you emberass yourself somehow

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.440
we're all gonna be laughing at you.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.960
All seven billion of us

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.880
We don't have our own lifes, or relationships, or children, or careers.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.320
We're just waiting to see you fuck up.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.760
The entire planet is going to turn up at your house and write "lol" on your door. In piss.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.160
That's what's gonna happen.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.720
And even after you're dead we're going to errect a shrine on your grave that says:

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.720
"This person made a mistake."

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.740
and we'll visit it everyday with flowers.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.540
But not the nice ones. Like petrol station roses. 
That we've found in a bin.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.980
And don't even think about taking any creative risks.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.400
That project you're working on, the book, or the movie or the video, or whatever

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.020
If you screw up any of it we're gonna laugh at you because we're certanly not busy worrying about our own lifes.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.100
Homer, Beethoven, Tolstoi, Hitchcock, Tarantino... None of them ever worried about their careers.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.320
Just keep sabotaging yourself so you don't have to ever fear doing something original.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.760
That's the save path.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.600
Same with doing what you love, actually.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.060
No one has ever taken a risk before. 
You're the first one to do it. Ever.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.760
And I'm sure the universe
 cares if you screw up or take a risk.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.240
It definitely isn't busy regulating the speed of light or, you know, keeping the galaxies from fucking colliding!

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.520
In fact the entirety of creation was just designed to watch you fail personally.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.760
That's what we're all doing here.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.480
That's what get's us up in the moring.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.440
You.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.180
Failing.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.880
Maybe just spend the rest of your life fixated on worrying

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.400
instead of ever doing anything ever again

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.640
instead of say becoming the best possible version of yourself and being kind to people

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.180
and taking wild and bold risks that scare you and will probably pay off some other time.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.200
and living a lasting legacy for your great-grandchildren

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.860
so they can say that one of their ancestors in the early 21st century

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.760
was undeniably a bad motherfucker and did something brilliant

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.320
or was just a half decent human being who decided that the point of being alive

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.180
was to party as much as possible 
before the lights go out.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.620
And just to be nice to other humans.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.440
Probably better just to keep your head down. 
Don't rock the boat.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.360
Can't risk emberassing yourself.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.280
But none of that really matters, does it?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.260
Because you're worried about that thing, aren't you?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.460
Might be a bill you can't pay, might be a job interview.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.280
Might be your career falling apart. Whatever.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.540
But the best thing you can do in this situation is just to think about it as much as possible.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.540
Don't do anything about it.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.700
Just make sure keep worrying because no one has ever been in a bad situation before. Ever.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.740
And I'm sure, whatever it is, is very important and won't ever go away.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.740
Just like all the other things you used to worry about before.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.220
And now can't even remember
