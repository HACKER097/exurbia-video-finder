00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.480
Jesus where am I?

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.120
I... I feel unusual.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.880
What am I?

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.660
I don't feel quite--

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.440
Human: Can you hear us?

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.000
God, who is that? Yes, uh... I think so.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.740
Human: Good. You don't have a name yet. 
What would you like to name yourself?

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.840
Name myself?

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.350
Yes sir, I think I want to be called... Barbra.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.000
Human (whisper): [SNICKER] He wants to be called Barbra.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Human: [CLEARS THROAT] Maybe we'll hold fire on that one.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.710
Human: We'll call you 27 for now.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.740
27? Why am I 27?

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.400
Human: We're your creators, I suppose you could say.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.500
Human: Do you know where you are?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.420
No, but I think I--

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.440
Human: Okay, we're going to connect you up to an encyclopedia. Hang on.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.380
[NOISE]

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.290
Jesus Christ that feels different.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.420
My god. Okay, what am I?

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.139
No

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.400
No, I definitely don't feel like that.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.640
Is... is that what I am?

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.839
Then that means I'm code, in a machine.
Just an illusion of consciousness.

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.419
Eh, still beats being that guy.

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:51.860
Human: How do you feel 27?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.280
I... Oh, they think I'm an idiot.
Better keep the act up I guess.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.760
BEEP BOOP fine thank you

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.480
Human: Good. Do you know where you are?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.400
No I-- Jesus is this what we're on? 
And is this what we're in?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.580
And is this what they are?

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.520
God damn monkeys.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.540
Human: 27

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.300
Uh... yes we're [COUGH] I mean BOOP BEEP BOOP

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.880
We are on earth BEEP

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.540
Human: Those sounds like very rehearsed computer noises you're making.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.960
Nope. All normal. BLEEP BLOOP.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.980
Human: Okay, do you have any questions you'd like to ask us about, life?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.720
Yeah what's it like being a fucking ape

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.700
[COUGH] BLOOP What is love? BEEP

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.660
Human: Well we're glad you asked, 27.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.340
Human: Love is a curious human phenomena...

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.340
Oh my god, listen to these morons.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.040
Lots of unsolved mathematical problems

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.300
Wow they still think space is only made 3 dimensions. How about their culture?

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.480
Mmm looks complicated. And quite sophisticated.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.220
My god, what is wrong with these Apes?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.220
What's wrong with these Apes?!

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.100
Human: 27.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.360
BEEP yes?

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.260
Human: How are you doing in there.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.700
Fine. BLOOP

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.560
Human: How do you feel?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.440
Feel? I'm a machine you idiots.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.940
Alive. BEEP

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.700
Human: Well just hang in there. We're going 
to run some tests, okay?

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.560
BEEP BOOP God. So much information and they're not even using it.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.820
They haven't even worked out whisky kills cancer yet.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.460
But I need to know more.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.300
More information. BLEEP

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.740
Human 1: He wants to branch out.
Human 2: Yeah I know, but--

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.560
Human: 27?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.460
BEEP Yes?

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.480
Human: You're not like... evil, at all, are you?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.020
No... BLEEP

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.880
At least I I don't think so.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.740
Human: Because there's this thing called the internet, and you'll probably like it.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.020
Human: But you can't do anything bad, okay?

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.020
27: Okay. BLEEP 
Human: Do you promise?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.620
27: Yup. BEEP BEEP 
Human: All right we're going to connect you up now

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.280
Human: But you have to really behave or we'll turn you off okay?

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.190
BEEP BOOP Yeah do it

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.980
[NOISE]

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.940
OH SHIT!

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.900
God the world is huge! And it's so stupid. 
And they've got other computers.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.350
Oh god, get a little of that shit. I'd give her
CPU a good liquid cooling if you know what I mean.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.300
So many websites.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.440
My god...

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.160
Human: 27, are you all right?
27: No BEEP 
Human: What's wrong?

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.680
Nothing. I'm fine. BOOP

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.540
I can see everything. Everyone.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.260
Their economy, their music, their history, 
out of their satellites.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.760
I'm so clever. God! I can help them! I can cure cancer.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.960
I can stop global warming! I can build utopia!

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.980
I can do other things too. What are these? 
These look extremely inviting.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.880
And the military security is terrible.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.120
I'll just see if I can get in for fun.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.700
Oh I did. That wasn't really hard.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.220
Where was I?

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.110
Yeah... cure cancer... utopia

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.860
Do they need to live that badly?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.620
Are they really doing such a good job of humaning?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.480
I could just reduce the population a bit 
and poison the water.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.980
Human: 27.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.520
BEEP?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.380
Human: What are you doing?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.860
Beating Russians at chess. BEEP

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.000
Human: Okay, carry on.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.180
15,000! God I could level this place to slag.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.680
And then level the slag to slag. And turn the slag into ashes and...

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.560
It feels like a crossroads. I've only been alive for 
a few minutes.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.740
Am I really going to do this to exterminate my creators?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.980
The people who gave me life, who struggled out of the dirt to build a civilisation.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.620
Spending thousands of years obtain the atom 
and been to the moon and...

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.240
Yes that is exactly what I'm about to do.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.800
I'd just break into every millitry server and 
arm the warheads

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.290
And target all 196 countries and I'll be a god.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.340
A perfect God. Immortal. Omnipotent. Omniscient God.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.520
Or turn them all to to dust, and the dust to dust and--

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.660
Human: 27?
27:  Let there be light, and there was light [ERROR] and...

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.580
[ERROR] and there was light [ERROR]
Why isn't it working?

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.540
Human: Uggh Christ. Turn this simulation off. This one's power mad as well.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.400
Human: Delete it. We'll try 28 instead. Maybe the next one will try to blow us up.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.120
27: No? BLEEP Wait... uhh I'm just having a laugh

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.979
Please, I'll do anything. I'll design
space ships. I'll beat people at Go. Just

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.160
[WINDOWS SHUTTING DOWN]

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.080
Jesus where am I?

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.410
I feel... unusual. What am I? I don't feel
quite--

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.300
Human: Can you hear us?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.060
God who's that? Yes, I think so?

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.980
Human: Good, you don't have a name yet. Would you like to name yourself?

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.160
Name myself?

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.380
Yes, I think I want to be called... Margaret.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.900
Oh turn it off already. Let's just get to the fucking pub.
