00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.260
So congratulations

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.139
you've just been appointed as the minister of spacey stuff and

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.080
Tax evasion

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.479
So one day you're chilling in your new office when you notice an email turns up from the Prime Minister himself

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.939
Well done on the new position. Can't congratulate you in person; things are a bit taxing at the moment, lolol.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.129
Oh, by the way, as the minister of spacey stuff

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.150
You need to get humans to the nearest star system by this time next year, or I'll excuse your wife and children

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.859
I'm granting you infinite funds

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.189
Love and kisses. Dave seems a bit harsh for the first day on the job

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.780
But whatever how hard can it be don't we have really good rockets now?

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.789
Anyway, so using conventional rockets with our nearest star system

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.070
Alpha Centauri being about four light-years away

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.600
Yeah, we could manage that no problem and arrive sometime around

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.059
100 years yeah, that's not gonna fly. Alright, Chill, Winston

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.680
You've got infinite money no problem

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.860
How are we gonna get to the stars then you do a little bit of googling?

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.949
Luckily Clever people have been thinking about this for a very long time now

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.839
so you're going to draw up a little list and split it in two which are methods that are slower than lights and

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.219
methods that are faster

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.020
Well, you've got a year to get there and Alpha Centauri is about four light years away,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.099
so let's go faster than light instead

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.550
Yeah

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.769
But isn't that supposed to be impossible because Einstein

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.790
Yeah, probably

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.830
But there might be fun ways around us so Einstein was pretty clear that stuff can't travel faster than light

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.049
To make stuff go fast you have to put energy in and the faster it goes the more energy you need yeah

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.069
So there isn't enough energy in the known universe to get a single electron to the speed of light

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.930
But there might be hacks could we use a wormhole maybe well yeah, there's some good maths behind, er

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.740
There's also some good

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.759
Maths behind wire tortoise could be Usain Bolt in a Sprint so best to be sceptical of good maths

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.059
But chances are to keep the math for one hole open you're gonna need some stuff called exotic matter which we don't have any of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.200
At the moment also keep in mind if you invent wormholes somehow

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.759
getting to the stars will be the least of your worries because anyone

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.259
With a screw loose could just start funneling energy from the sun into your bedroom any other good ideas

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.578
Then yeah another quick Google search you find out about a thing called the Alcubierre drive stuff

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.600
Can't go faster than light

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.460
But maybe you can bend the rules a bit

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.080
So you use exotic matter

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.380
which we don't have remember

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.339
to shrink the space in front of a starship and expand it behind it this

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.899
Won't piss Einstein off, but it might get around his rules about speed because you're not actually accelerating matter

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.700
So the prime minister writes to you again the tax cattle thing is blowing up a bit need to Lie low a while

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.320
I'll give you a few centuries to get to a star instead. Well, that's good. We can use normal physics

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.809
So we've got standard Rockets which are fine

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.120
But will take a while to get to Alpha Centauri like a hundred years

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.970
can't we just freeze the crew for the journey

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.000
Yeah, great idea except that definitely brain damages people

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.609
unless you want to go to Alpha Centauri, so you can dribble at it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.080
Maybe that won't work so well well

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.249
How about we build a generation ship you know like in pandorum because that went really well?

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.219
For them the first generation of the crew bring up the next generation

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.089
And so on and finally by say the third generation the crew arrive yeah

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.430
Maybe I mean assuming there isn't a revolution or total psychological collapse like regularly happens on Earth all the time

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.249
Yeah, why not, but really the problem here is the same with all of this stuff. Which is once again Bloody Einstein

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.679
We all know now that the closer you get to the speed of light the more time slows down relative to you

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.020
So when you arrive off-center, I may be only a few years have passed for you, but decades might have passed on Earth

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.270
But hold your horses there's another small

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.679
Nickel even if you pull it off, and we've got a galactic British Empire

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.250
How do you communicate some stars are thousands of light-Years away? Hi?

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.740
We've run out of milk, and we're not drinking black tea because we're not fucking Barbarians, please send milk

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.540
 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.740
Okay, full fat or semi skims

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.038
What who who cares fine Semi Skimmed

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.620
Organic or non-organic?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.340
Non-Organic is fine

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.390
supermarket stuff or like

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.980
Independent farm milk

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.940
wait it's been seven thousand years, jesus christ.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.729
Yeah. Yeah, fine finer. Okay, okay? I will sort it

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.940
So is semi-skimmed the one with the green lid or

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.849
and yeah one more stanner in the works then let's say you've got a few

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.680
Planets in your empire and everything's going great

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.349
How are you going to keep them loyal to earth exactly say one of them wants to declare itself independent. What are you gonna?

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.579
Do write them a strongly worded letter or say there's a revolution. They need back up. yeah

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.019
Yeah, no problem helps on the way

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.809
It should be with you in about all 1/2 1/2 thousand years

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.330
But the Catalan will be there pronto so with all that in mind

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.640
Maybe you should just step

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.209
down and take a job at the ministry of silly Walks

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.509
Instead because it's just not feasible is it we're not going to the stars

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.690
We don't have the technology energy or ambition and to be honest

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.130
Maybe we can just give up with all of those other impossible things we want to do like crossing the Ocean

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.529
Oh, we did that already, a bad example well, then like heavier-than-air flying machines

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.820
oh, oh yeah, we we licked that one as well or getting to the moon that's completely stupid

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.419
oh, wait all of those things were supposed to be completely impossible

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.099
And they were until we did them obviously we've got a pretty good track record

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.679
So far really there are plenty of reasons to remain optimistic

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.119
About traveling to the stars even if it's a few centuries away hang back. take it easy

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.739
We'll probably work it out at some point. Maybe take a holiday in the meantime somewhere kind of tropical

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.729
Central America, I hit panama is lovely this time of year
