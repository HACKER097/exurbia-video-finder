00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
Right.

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.980
Two ducks, on a pond, and they're twins.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.800
Let's say one will always be what's called spin up, and the other, spin down.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.060
You know for a fact that if you measure duck one, and it's position is up,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.380
duck two will be fixed in the opposite state.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.380
Now, for some reason sub-atomic particles behave in this way under certain conditions.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.120
This phenomenon is usually known as:

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.660
or...

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.100
However...

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.580
What's weird is that you can do this experiment across the pond,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.500
across the world,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.740
across the galaxy,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.020
and measure one duck, and the other duck will always take the opposite spin position, regardless of distance.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.100
And the effect seems to happen faster than light.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.100
But as we all know, according to a certain German someone,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.320
"Guten Tag!  Deutsche Menschen."  (Good day!  German people.)

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.880
Light is the ultimate speed limit in the universe.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.300
Nothing can break it.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.640
So, how can they tell each other to fix their spin across space, faster than the speed of light itself?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.360
Well,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.080
what if they carry a little rulebook with them when they set off from Earth, telling each other what to do when they arrive?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.580
Nup!

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.040
Experiments confirm that is NOT happening.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.760
So, just how are the little rapscallions communicating with each other?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.560
Well actually it's quite straightforward.  It's due to a well understood effect in physics called:

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.280
Nobody fucking knows!

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.800
A now, a short message, from the universe's legal team.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.300
[📞🌌  WHAT!?]

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.780
The universe accepts no responsiblity for violation of causality,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.960
*Kiss kiss*

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.460
Moving on...

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240
If you want to imagine an electron, first think of a basketball.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.560
Now pop the basketball,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.120
BURN IT,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.200
because it's nothing like an electron, alright?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.820
However...

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.160
sometimes particles such as electrons behave like pond water, in waves.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.060
And for some reason, as soon as you put a detector next to the experiment, they fix their state and collapse into ducks,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.160
or particles,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.780
as though,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.440
*~Whistling~*

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.560
So what's really going on down there at the quantum level?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.840
Is it all waves, or particles, or is it both?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.460
Is matter a particle and a wave fundamentally?

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.060
This is generally known as the:

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.740
and no one has a sure answer to this one either, yet.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.300
If you're into theoretical physics pornography, by the way,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.420
do be sure to check out the 'Double-Slit Experiment.'

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.420
And if you thought that was strange, well,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.680
you're in luck, because it gets stranger.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.660
For as long as you're not observing the pond, we have to say that the duck is everywhere, across all points on the pond, simultaneously.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.280
Only once we observe the pond does it collapse into a duck.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.460
And for all the time it's unobserved, we have it's in something called:

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.320
or...

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240
Now, this allows us to do some cool stuff with computers.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.600
Modern computation is built on ones and zeroes.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.060
Or black ducks and white ducks.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.620
That's it.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.600
String enough together and you get computation.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.360
And somewhere down the line, much later,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.960
Overwatch,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.660
eBay,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.980
and /r/birdswitharms. [💪🐦👊]

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.680
because of quantum superposition, where ducks can be in multiple states at once, you can,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.600
apparently,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.880
build a computer that uses:

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.480
That is ducks in both a black, and white at the same time,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.900
running calculations that physicists refer to as:

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.880
"Bigger than your mother's dick pic collection."

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.040
And there's some other weirdness going on.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.040
Par exemple: (For example)

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.560
Imagine ducks in a pond, all of them are awake.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.640
If we leave them, they'll fall asleep by evening.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.040
But if we keep observing them, and by observing, I mean periodically shouting:

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.340
"OI, YOU LITTLE POULTRY BASTARDS!"

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.780
They'll theoretically all stay awake indefinitely.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.460
Kind of works with particles too.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.420
...Sort of.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.740
A beautiful piece of math that not only made grandpimp relativity and quantum mechanics kiss and make up a bit,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.260
but it also lead to the prediction that aren't just ducks,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.700
but anti-ducks existing in the universe.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.600
Which we now know to be true.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.180
So that's neat!

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.420
These are algorithms that deal with superposition computing that we chatted about earlier.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.100
These can be used to do some calculations,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.800
much,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.680
MUCH faster than classical computers, such as estimating sums.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.460
Leading to Jay-Z's immortal line:

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.840
Right!  And that's quantum mechanics.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.700
I mean... not really, it's just a shit approximation.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.360
But you get the idea!  Sorry if it doesn't...

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.180
fit the bill.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.580
There is a kind of interesting question underneath all of this though.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.120
Right now, we're living in:

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.440
which rests on:

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.480
I guess?  Which rests on:

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.780
and let's just go down on the universe for a moment.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.520
*GUFFAW*

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.180
And near the bottom, everything is built on quantum mechanics, apparently.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.220
And down here, nothing is quite as we recognize it.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.360
Particles don't really have to find locations,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.760
matter isn't solid,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.400
and logic is off getting wankered by itself in the corner.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.180
Why is nature like this, down here in the quantum world,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.420
with spins, and charges, and wave functions?

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.620
Do universes have to be build like this, or do we live in just one variation of possibly trillions of different ways you can configure a universe?

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.340
And most importantly...

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.620
In any case, who knows what's coming next.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.540
Maybe a quantum computing revolution.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.260
Maybe a whole new understanding of the structure of reality itself.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.060
Or, even harder to imagine,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.040
maybe certain newspapers actually behaving with journalistic integrity when it comes to new media.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.180
Not fucking likely.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.420
[Captioner here.  Normally I'd shill out for exurb1a here.]

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.520
[I still will, you should donate to his patreon and such.]

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.660
[But considering it's starting to get into the Spring months for the Northern hemisphere,]

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.620
[and this video was mostly about ducks (right?)]

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.700
[If you're considering going to a local park or duck pond to feed the ducks, be considerate.]

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.780
[Don't feed ducks white bread, it gives them diarrhea, and other mallardies.]

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.840
[Consider halved seedless grapes, frozen peas, or corn instead.]

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.660
[Alright see you if you sticked around this far!]

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.600
[❤  \🐢]

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.000
[There are no duck emojis. :c]
