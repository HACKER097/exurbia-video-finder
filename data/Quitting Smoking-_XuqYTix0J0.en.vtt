00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.900
(Captioner here.  Uh.)

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.920
(There isn't really any dialog until the minute mark, so.)

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.780
(Nor is there an end slide.)

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.880
(So I guess I'm shilling out Exurb1a's Patreon at the start of the video?)

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.300
(That.. doesn't seem right.)

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.000
(Hrm.)

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.820
(Mmm...)

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.540
(Oh, I got it!)

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.580
(This is sort of an anti-smoking video, so...)

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.540
(if you are smoking, you should try stopping.)

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.360
(Then you can use the money you save on Exurb1a's Patreon.)

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.880
(At https://www.patreon.com/exurb1r .)

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.880
(Get the sixty dollar tier, and have Exurb1a livestream himself smoking.)

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.120
(Boom, loopholed.)

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.120
(All the satisfaction of smoking without any chance of death.)

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.300
(Either way, dialog's about to start, enjoy it!)

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.000
(&lt;3)

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.120
[???] Hey.  Stop that.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.040
[Exurb1a] What?  W-who are you?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.320
[???] Put that cigarette down now at once.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.900
[Exurb1a] Is this a schizophrenic episode?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.400
(No that's next week)

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.020
Ugh, I knew LSD and muesli don't mix.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.320
[???] No, this is the personified voice of the cosmos.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.620
From the end of time.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.880
And your help is required.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.260
[Exurb1a] Right.  Wha- why are you in my head?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.460
[PVotC] Why are you in your head?

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.840
[Exurb1a] Yeah.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.440
Okay, fair point.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.260
[PVotC] You see, the fate of creation relies on you.  Today.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.720
[Exurb1a] I mean, I was planning to just have a beer and watch the evening news.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.540
To be honest.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.740
[PVotC] We both know that's not what you do in the evenings. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.820
[Exurb1a] ...yeah, alright.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.080
Anyway, so you're omniscient, are you?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.200
[PVotC]  ...What, what does that mean.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.840
[Exurb1a] Seriousl-

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.200
It means you know everything.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.700
[PVotC] Oh yes.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.200
Yes.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.980
Very clever.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.480
Certainly.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.760
[Exurb1a] What are next week's lottery numbers?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.500
[PvotC] Well I...

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.240
I mean... there are loads of them.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.900
So...

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.780
[Exurb1a] What was the one thing meatloaf wouldn't do for love?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.460
[PVotC] Uhh...

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.680
The Atkins... Diet?

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.160
[Exurb1a] Why did mum walk out on us?

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.460
[PVotC] I- I don't know!

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.220
This isn't Twenty fucking Questions!

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.880
You're probably excessively ugly!

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.040
Moving on.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.720
You see, the fate of creation relies on you not smoking that cigarette.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.040
[Exurb1a] That kind of seems like a very contrived plot device,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.960
from a YouTube channel that's ultimately running out of ideas and doesn't...

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.760
[PVotC] Possibly!

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.040
Witness...

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.260
it's like this:

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.220
Creation is cyclic.  The Big Bang has happened trillions of times.  Over, and over.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.560
And the universe always unfolds in the same way.  In every iteration.  And...

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.740
Are you listening?

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.380
[Exurb1a] ...Yes.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.480
[PVotC] Thus, you have lived a trillion lives.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.440
All in the same sequence, recurring again, and again.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:54.780
However, to break out of this cycle, it is necessary that one, single, novel action must be performed to send the causal chain off in a new direction.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.320
And...

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.840
ARE YOU LISTENING!?

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.940
[Exurb1a, mouth full]  Uh huh.  Yeah.  Go on.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.640
[PVotC] One deviation is all that's required to set creation free from an infinite loop.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.180
Do you understand?

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.560
[Exurb1a] Yes.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.720
Probably?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.780
[PVotC] Are you willing to assist?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.820
[Exurb1a] By not smoking this cigarette?

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.280
[PVotC] By not smoking that cigarette.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.380
[Exurb1a] But I -really- want to.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.460
[PVotC] You know it kills you, of course!

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.920
[Exurb1a] Yeah, but it tastes nice!

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.820
[PVotC] No it doesn't!

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.380
It is possible to enjoy life without the risk of death for the sake of smelling like shit.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.060
[Exurb1a] Phf.  I doubt it.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.700
[PVotC] Silence!

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.040
You started because you were fourteen and thought it looked cool and now you can't stop.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.720
It's time to quit forever!

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.300
Creation depends on it.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.940
[Exurb1a]  Alright.  So what do I get in return?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.660
[PVotC] A... significantly decreased likelihood of aggressive tumors?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.860
...And a much improved life expectancy?

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.320
G-greater lung capacity?

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.220
Ugh.  Superpowers?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.200
[Exurb1a]  Ayyyyyyy.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.820
[PVotC] Go on then.  What kind.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.460
[Exurb1a] Well I... I've always wanted to fly.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.420
[PVotC] Biologically impossible.  What else.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.680
[Exurb1a]  Mm... Invisibility?

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.980
[PVotC] Logically infeasible.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.320
[Exurb1a] Well I, I guess I've always...

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.120
wanted...

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.160
slightly bigger hands?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.680
[PVotC] Slightly bigger hands it is!

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.980
Now, we have a pact.  Do you consent?

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.980
To serving as the catalyst in a cosmic revolution?

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.240
[Exurb1a] Uh... Yeah, alright.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.180
[PVotC] Liberating creation from the shackles of eternal recurrence, and becoming possibly the most important human in the history of your species?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.400
And all you need to do to achieve this, to rewrite time itself,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.520
in the fashion of a god,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.320
to return free will to the cosmos,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.020
is refrain from a stupid and harmful habit with only the slightest application of willpower and,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.800
[Exurb1a] Sorry! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.520
[PVotC] Oh you're such a cock!
