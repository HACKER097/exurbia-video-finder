00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.040
Yeah, I know what you're thinking:

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.180
"Where'd you come up with that title, genius? On the fucking toilet?"

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.660
Well, y...

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.100
Yes, actually.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.580
And that's because today we're mainly going to be talking about consciousness and-

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.600
Jesus what the f-

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.900
FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAR

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.720
Fear is an automatic response in your brain to perceived scary shit.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.780
But fear itself is not under your conscious control.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.240
It is automatic, and if it's automatic,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.960
then that is not you.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.380
It is a thing your brain does, but it is not a thing that YOU do – conscious You.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.220
So presumably, there's stuff in your brain you don't control,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.520
and then there's stuff in your brain that you do control.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.340
Stuff that is you.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.980
Let's find out where the line is, then, shall we?

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.800
Well, for most of the day so far, you've been blinking and breathing automatically.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.400
Congratulations, keep it up –

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.920
but now you're thinking about it, so you're doing it manually.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.420
Anyway, you'll forget about it in a few minutes, and all of that will become automatic again.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.280
So that is not you.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.220
Okay, what next?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.400
Well, what about the things you like? Surely we choose those.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.540
Let's say, your music taste, for example.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.025
Good music activates the part of the brain dealing with euphoric reward response,

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:07.820
or the bit that makes you feel nice.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.500
Okay, fine. But did you CHOOSE to prefer Metallica over Beethoven,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.400
or over the blood-curdling sound of two cats banging outside?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.940
No, obviously not – otherwise you'd just choose to prefer everything.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.020
Even though you can choose what to listen to, the preference itself –

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.600
what presses your musical, or food-ish, or social buttons – is out of your control.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.960
So that is also not you.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.520
Okay, so we'll push the line over a bit more.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.940
You don't control what scares you,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.660
you don't control basic survival stuff,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.860
you don't control what you enjoy – so, okay,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.660
but at least you can choose what your brain is processing, right? Where to put your mind.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.780
Yeah, well... Not always.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.340
If you're a native English speaker, or just fluent in English,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.540
you're not choosing to understand these words, are you?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.200
They're just coming in, and your brain is doing the work for you.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.700
Like, try to hear these syllables without the meaning.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.060
AN ADEQUATE KITCHEN.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.280
A STATIONARY FOOTBALL.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.980
TWO CATS REENACTING A SCENE FROM THE MOTION PICTURE "TITANIC",

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.600
HAVING PROVIDED A RUBBER RING FOR THE MICE.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.380
AN ANTHROPOMORPHIZED DOG,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.920
OFF FOR HIS FINAL EXAM BEFORE QUALIFYING AS A LUMBERJACK.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.100
A MAN SUCCESSFULLY COMBINING HIS RESPONSIBILITIES AS AN ACCOUNTANT

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.640
WITH HIS LOVE OF NAUTICAL TOURISM.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.780
A MAN WITH A HITHERTO UNEXPLAINED EYE CONDITION ATTEMPTING TO PLAY A PIECE OF MUSIC ON THE ABACUS,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.040
WHILE NOT GRIPPING THE ABACUS CORRECTLY.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.860
AND A DOCTOR WHO IS ABOUT TO DESTROY A BURGER, AS WELL AS THE MAJORITY OF HIS LEFT HAND,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.340
WITH THE HELP OF, IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, A SILENCED WALTHER PPK.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.680
It's impossible – because language processing, when you're good enough, is automatic.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.280
So that is not you.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.140
Okay, Jesus, but what about high level stuff? What about playing instruments, or driving a car?

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.020
That must take awareness. That can't be automatic.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.100
Yeah, okay, probably – for the first while.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.480
But if you play an instrument, you may have noticed your fingers just know what they're doing – automatically.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.320
Or if you drive, you know It's possible to get from A to B in a car,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.300
and spend the entire time having an argument in your head with your dad,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.840
'cause he still hasn't bought you that fucking Etch A Sketch!

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.180
...while never actually thinking about changing gear or pushing the pedals.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.580
So high-level motor coordination, when you practice it, can be completely automatic too.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.000
Yeah, okay, but at least simple motor tasks are in your control –

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.920
moving a hand, or a leg, or whatever.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160
Yeah...

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.820
Or not.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.760
Very simply, Benjamin Libet did a fairly famous experiment

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.500
with getting people to press a button randomly when they felt like it.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.280
He was monitoring their brain activity while they did this.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.500
The weird thing is that the brain seems to be preparing to push the button a disturbing length of time

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.060
before people were reporting choosing to press the button itself.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.260
There are problems with this experiment, for sure,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.280
but it does seem a bit like the systems underneath you – underneath being conscious –

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.500
might be way more essential than the conscious systems themselves,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.120
and that choosing to do stuff is maybe just a game the brain plays afterwards

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.780
to justify what it was already going to do anyway.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.700
Maybe.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.440
Okay, so fear isn't you,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.760
survival stuff isn't you,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.860
preference isn't you,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.540
lots of motor control isn't you –

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.460
Christ, what else is going on in there that isn't you?

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.200
Well... a fair bit, actually.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.080
Like, oh, you know...

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.860
Balancing when you walk,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.340
or falling asleep and waking up,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.240
or remembering who you are – or where you are, or when you are,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.960
or fetching memories in the first place,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.640
or taking all of the perceptions that are coming in through your senses

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.080
and turning them into a coherent picture of the world that actually makes fucking sense,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.160
or even just processing everything at the same time,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.260
or processing text,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.240
or perceiving color,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.320
or just pretty much anything – most of it is automatic,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.780
or at least not mediated by you consciously.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.480
Is there anything in your brain that you do control, then,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.240
you silly... clever mess?!

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.580
Yeah, let's start by you closing your eyes.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.300
Go on. Are they closed? They bloody better be.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.740
Nothing nasty is gonna come up on the screen, or anything.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.220
All right? Closed?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.320
Cool.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.560
If you listen to my voice for a moment, and just try to ignore how grating and pretentious it is,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.780
if you put everything else out of your mind – all the anxieties, and the neuroses, all the sensations of your body –

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.580
You will find that underneath all of that is nothing but awareness.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.240
There's no obvious you on the inside, there's no tiny cat pulling levers and pressing buttons.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.460
There's no center to being conscious.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.360
It's just presence. It's just awareness.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.120
There are sensations, and awareness of sensations.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.280
and then processes – probably most of them automatic.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.500
You, as a thing, don't seem to have a center, if you look for one.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.740
You – conscious you – do not really exist, not concretely, to be very simple about it.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.760
That is the idea, anyway.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.800
Go on, then – open your eyes, you scallywag.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.880
Another automatic process in the brain might be the system that says:

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.860
"I am a thing with a sentient self. There is something on the inside doing the experiencing, and it is me."

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.420
But maybe... there isn't.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.800
Maybe there just fucking isn't. And what then?

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.920
Well, insulting sign off followed by jaunty classical music.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.820
Довиждане!

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.700
Hang on a second!
Look, even if you are kind of a lie –

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.560
which you might be, me too –

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.760
you are still self-aware, whatever happens, and that is pretty unique.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.160
We don't know how self-aware other animals are.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.980
Almost no animals recognize their reflection, for some reason.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.700
Except maybe some of the great apes,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.940
possibly dolphins, elephants, and...

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.240
magpies, for some... reason?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.800
But a bigger question is:

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.980
if there are other species in the universe – and there probably are –

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.540
and if they've been around a while – and they probably have –

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.860
are they self-aware?

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.840
We always seem to make out that advanced aliens will have gone down similar lines to us:

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.720
starting as cells, going up and up,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.480
building fast food joints, smoking doobies, etc.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.800
But would they be self-aware necessarily?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.460
Like, maybe evolution accidentally made some higher mammals on earth self-aware

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.640
because it's better for problem-solving or something in this one case.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.460
Maybe it was just one of those weird drunken experiments nature undertakes sometimes,

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.420
like platypuses, or Winchester.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.040
Maybe we just got really lucky.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.500
This might be a one-time trick in the Universe, and WE got to take it for a test drive.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.320
And that really gets one thinking, because what we need is a global holiday.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.980
And we'll call it "Being Alive Is Fucking Cool" Day,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.480
where everyone gets the day off, and just for a bit, even for a few hours,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.920
takes the time to remember that everyone you meet, however shit, is kind of a miracle in plain sight.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.180
And on global "Being Alive Is Fucking Cool" Day,

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.940
we'll all eat donuts and take leisurely strolls in the park, and be cool to everyone,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.080
and around three o'clock solemnly put our hands on our hearts and pledge the following:

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.440
"That as the sperm that won the race, as the mud that woke up,

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.180
as a blob of carbon currently taking the shape of a human,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.040
I do declare that the world is fucking cool, and being self-aware is fucking cool,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.380
and I shall henceforth hold doors open for people,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.140
and fill pints right up to the top with only minimal foam,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.280
and endeavor not to be a knob, unless it's absolutely necessary.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.960
And I do hereby furthermore declare that getting bored in a universe this weird is unacceptable,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.860
and if that happens, I should probably take up the tuba, or organize a water fight."

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.460
We shall have bad days, yes?

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.920
We shall have good days, yes?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.420
All the while remembering that most things in the universe don't even have fucking days at all.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.220
Even if it's all a facade, there is something on the inside that knows it's a thing.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.120
And that is the cat's pajamas.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.180
That is the veritable lobster's bottom.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.840
Oh, and there'll be hats, and free beer, and bouncy castles,

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.800
and I will see you there, carbon units.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.000
Re-Se-Ve-Peh,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.760
Byob,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.160
now Ge-Te-Fe-Oh.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.840
