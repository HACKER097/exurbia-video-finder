00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
Starfleet reports our last six crew members
are ready to beam up,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.720
but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.680
Oh? I'll see to it that he beams up.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.460
We're losing their pattern!

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.380
Oh no, they're forming.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.220
We're always like: What's Bones's 
problem?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.960
Just get in the transporter, Bones.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.092
Why are you being such a pussy, Bones?

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.940
Do you think there's something really bad in the transporter, Bones?

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.440
Did it touch your bones?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.480
Yeah, well, Bones is actually the bravest character in sci-fi history

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.270
because it's
the only person who's worked out this is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.609
A FUCKING DEATH MACHINE and still
willingly steps into it.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.220
So, you get in at one end, get disassembled, transmitted
across space as a signal,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.199
reassembled at the other end, which is fine if you're, you know, a Word document or a phone call,

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.581
or expendable or something, but not
human, yeah?

00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:53.932
Like, if we took away the bit where you reassembled, this would just be

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.220
a scene of several people calmly walking to their deaths.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.360
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, bye, bye, bye bye, see - yeah, see
you in fucking Valhalla that is!

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.340
In fact, sci-fi becomes one long tragic story of
people committing genocide

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.600
in the most British and orderly way possible:

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.820
stepping up to their deaths like they're
cuing for flu shots.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.000
All sci-fi has two modes of teleporting, if you like: one is
called a wormhole

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880
and one is called fucking dying.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.600
A wormhole is a bridge in space where you tie
two points together and step through.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.000
It's a shortcut and no one dies.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.530
The
other is where you break someone down

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.469
molecule by molecule and vaporize them,
so they're dead.

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.439
But you make a copy at the end so
apparently it's not killing.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.900
And obviously the copy doesn't feel like a
copy so there's no one left to protest.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.080
And all the while this guy is getting
called a pussy for not willingly stepping into the suicide machine.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.799
Yeah? Well, what about that one?

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.000
That's a wormhole, right? No, no, just
death.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You still get broken down and
reconstructed.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.280
Oh, well, how about- No, no, just death.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.860
Or - no. Also death.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.539
Well, then there's... Oh no, just
methodical genocide.

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.460
Yeah, that's how you travel in the future:
You want to see space?

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.149
Well it's the murder express or nothing!
