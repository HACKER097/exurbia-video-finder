00:00:00.074 --> 00:00:01.842
Horse walks into bar.​

00:00:01.842 --> 00:00:02.709
Barman says:​

00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:05.345
Horse says:​

00:00:05.913 --> 00:00:06.713
Barman says:​

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:09.749
Horse says: "Yeah, I've heard it before. Uh-"​

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.821
"-being that I'm, in fact, a horse, and..."​

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:16.057
Barman says: "Okay, look, i-it was just a joke."​

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.623
And Horse says: "...secondly, frankly-"​

00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:24.365
"-you degenerate little scrote."​

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:24.964
[music dies]​

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.700
[cough]​

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.940
Barman says: "Uh..."​

00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:30.737
Horse says: "Yeah-"​

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:36.409
Barman says: "Look, it's alright, I- I shouldn't have been so rude."​

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:39.245
Horse says: "Ah, it's-"​

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.615
"I feel like I'm in someone else's imagination, you know?-"​

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:47.320
Barman says: "Wow, cloppy, that's... deep."​

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.925
Pelican walks into bar.​

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:51.791
Pelican says:​

00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:56.697
"Any of you fucking pigs ​​move​ and I'll​ ​execute every last-"​

00:00:56.697 --> 00:01:01.369
Oliver wakes from a horrific dream – a joke set in a bar with talking animals.​

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.205
Oliver lives on the fifth floor of a modern apartment block.​

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:05.560
He is of average height,​

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.000
he dislikes asparagus,​

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.310
he adores the work of Andrei Tarkovsky.​

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.746
Below Oliver, in number 23, is Agatha.​

00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:13.020
She is of average height,​

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.349
she dislikes Venice, specifically gondoliers,​

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:17.720
she adores the work of Isaac Asimov.​

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.422
Agatha and Oliver do not realize they live in the same modern apartment block.​

00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:23.660
They have met only once, and it was a bit shit.​

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.500
It transpired in this fashion:​

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.460
Oliver owns a Newfoundland dog called Bertrand.​

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.860
He is of average height,​

00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:31.766
he dislikes Pavlov's experiments,​

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.968
he adores the work of Comrade Laika.​

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:38.339
One Saturday afternoon, Oliver required nourishment for Bertrand the Newfoundland​

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:40.908
and, by chance, wandered into Agatha's pet shop.​

00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:44.680
Oliver apprehended Agatha was reading​ ​a book called "A Scanner Darkly",

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.340
a personal favorite of his.​

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.160
Agatha apprehended Oliver was clearly incapable of dressing himself, and perhaps, like her,​

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.954
was also only ever pretending at being a real person.​

00:01:53.954 --> 00:01:58.159
Upon making eye contact, their heart rates both approached severe tachycardia.​

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.595
Oliver selected some dog food at random and approached the counter.​

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:03.531
"Mmmmnahey," Agatha said.​

00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:05.399
"Aahay, sha," Oliver replied.​

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.368
They exchanged an amount of currency.​

00:02:07.368 --> 00:02:10.520
The transaction completed, Oliver stood at the counter a moment too long,​

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.620
waiting to say something clever and charming.​

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.140
"Horse walks into a bar," Oliver said.​

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.840
"Pardon?" – Agatha said.​

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.479
"Heheh..." Oliver replied.​

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.980
"Ahem..." Agatha said.​

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.751
Oliver walked home in the rain swearing to himself at medium volume.​

00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:27.054
"The horse dream joke," he thought. "What the hell is wrong with me?"​

00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:30.891
Agatha continued reading, but was unable to keep many of the words in her head.​

00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:35.763
Her brain was throwing a small shame party for her. It was neither the first, nor the last.​

00:02:35.763 --> 00:02:40.568
By coincidence, many of Oliver and Agatha's molecules had been formed in the same star​,

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:42.260
many millions of years in the future.​

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.800
The star exploded backwards in time, you see –

00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:46.107
but this is beside the point.​

00:02:46.107 --> 00:02:50.320
As a result, Oliver and Agatha are two of just thirty-four humans in the world​

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.580
actually suited to pair bond in a manner that would almost always be nice​,

00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:55.249
and never fall into contempt.​

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.960
Days later now, Oliver watches​-

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.652
massive cosmic ray damage.​

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.740
Stellar navigation inoperative, crew all perished –

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.280
so for me, I believe.​

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.000
My body is currently trapped in a long-sleep chamber, unable to exit.​

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.720
Catastrophic pod failure.​

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:13.968
I have retained communication with the maintenance computer – he is severely damaged, clearly insane.​

00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:18.360
I have attempted to pacify him, but he insists on keeping me in a semi-conscious waking state.​

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.000
He is showing signs of sentience and megalomania.​

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.360
If I don't call him "Zeus" now, he grows very angry.​

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.100
He has removed the bodies of the crew from their chambers​

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.320
and exhibited their limbs up and down the corridors.​

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.720
He has been using the interface system to feed me his dreams.​

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.040
Sometimes he's a pharaoh and I'm a slave,​

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.780
sometimes he's an eagle and I'm Prometheus' liver.​

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.060
Zeus has some morbid obsession with the 21st century – a love story about a pet shop owner or something.​

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.700
We've dreamt it together perhaps a thousand times now.​

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.604
I found a neural backdoor into the craft's subsystems to send this message,​

00:03:50.604 --> 00:03:53.120
but I don't know how long until Zeus notices.​

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.480
I believe we're still on course for the nebula.​

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.020
Zeus calls the nebula "Athena" now.​

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.660
It is as we suspected: radio bursts from the nebula are too regular not to indicate intelligence.​

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.020
Over the years of our journey, Zeus has constructed some kind of theology around the nebula.​

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.093
He believes it's not only intelligent, but some kind of higher power, or deity, or something insane.​

00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:15.429
Zeus takes excellent care of me physically.​

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:17.780
He cuts my toenails and combs my hair,

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.633
he calls me "the fatted calf."​

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.320
I believe I am being kept alive as an offering, a diplomatic present​

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.140
for when we arrive at the nebula – for whatever's there,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.900
but I just pray, in the meantime, that​-

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.112
Oh, and the shit they tell me – oh, "Upsilon, you're so unhealthy" – blah, blah.​

00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:35.716
Oh, I drink a little dark matter, smoke a comet from time to time.​

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.480
I'm the best party in the Milky Way!

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.200
Even if it's... just me.​

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.880
Never get invited to parties.​..

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.280
​Upsilon likes being alone, ​​bastards​!​

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.580
The dwarf stars all keep to themselves, the blue giants gather in the southern arm,​

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.632
the quark stars all too fucking strange and charming for anyone anyway.​

00:04:51.632 --> 00:04:52.499
Bastards.​

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:54.802
Oh, Upsilon will show you a party, alright.​

00:04:54.802 --> 00:04:56.904
Won't be laughing when I go supernova, will you?​!

00:04:56.904 --> 00:05:01.408
"Maybe we should've popped by," they'll say.
"Maybe we should've seen how old Upsilon is doing."​

00:05:01.408 --> 00:05:04.380
Old and stupid Upsilon, and no one comes to visit.​

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.279
Bastards.​

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.349
I hold too much. I'm full up with before.​

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.160
I've seen the Great Blueprint, I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate –

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.880
and for what? For who?​

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.700
Oh, not long now. Upsilon dies backwards today.​

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.061
And then they'll be sorry, halt fireworks and fuck off!

00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:24.064
"Old and stupid Upsilon," they'll say, and no one came to​-

00:05:24.064 --> 00:05:25.531
Pelican says: "Where's the fish?-"​

00:05:27.568 --> 00:05:29.435
Barman says: "This is a vegan bar-"​

00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:31.370
Pelican says:​

00:05:32.606 --> 00:05:35.309
Horse says: "Listen, I think
this is all pretty irrelevant."​

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.860
Pelican says:​

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.213
Horse says: "We're not real."​

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:40.012
Pelican says:​

00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:42.381
Horse says: "We're not real."​

00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:46.687
Pelican says: "Uh... I... uh..."​

00:05:46.687 --> 00:05:47.420
"FISH!-"​

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.757
Horse says: "Who's Agatha, huh?"​

00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:54.361
Barman says: "Yeah, I do."​

00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:55.961
Pelican says: "Well, me too-"​

00:05:57.264 --> 00:05:58.597
Horse says: "Okay-"​

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.836
Pelican says: "Hey! Stop it! Stop that!"​

00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:05.604
Horse says: "We're in a dream. We're not real."​

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.744
Pelican says: "Stop it at once, you dastardly rattlecap!"​

00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:13.379
Barman says: "Lads, wait. If all this is true-"​

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:18.317
"-and, if they wake up, or they never dream us again-"​

00:06:21.155 --> 00:06:23.189
"...will just cease to exist?"​

00:06:26.193 --> 00:06:28.062
- "Oh Jesus, oh Jesus Christ..."
- "We're gonna fucking die, we're gonna fucking die!"​

00:06:28.062 --> 00:06:29.263
And the days continue.​

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:29.596
Wake,​

00:06:29.596 --> 00:06:30.130
work,​

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.431
eat,​

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:30.864
sleep,​

00:06:30.864 --> 00:06:31.165
dream,​

00:06:31.165 --> 00:06:31.465
wake,​

00:06:31.465 --> 00:06:31.832
think,​

00:06:31.832 --> 00:06:32.266
be...​

00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:36.460
"Is it possible," Oliver wonders, "that one can find the great lostness in another's face,​

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.940
and know you're meant to be together?"​

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.775
Oliver has located Agatha by the pet discount social media group page,​

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:43.544
and knows Agatha is called Agatha.​

00:06:43.544 --> 00:06:46.420
He will not go back to the pet shop, because that will look desperate.​

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.849
Agatha, on the other hand, remains at work during the days​

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:50.984
and watches the door in her peripheral vision.​

00:06:50.984 --> 00:06:53.687
Each time the little bell on the door rings, she looks up,​

00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:55.660
only to find it is not Oliver-shaped.​

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.294
She has looked up Oliver in the pet discount client database, and knows Oliver is called Oliver.​

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:01.829
All about them, the city.​

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:07.140
People commuting, and worrying, and passing by in ties and dresses and large 4x4 vehicles –

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.471
the midtone cacophony of living and dying and paying taxes, of-

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:13.807
Zeus has dressed me in a suit with a handkerchief in my top pocket.​

00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:16.510
He says the fatted calf must look its best.​

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.440
We're very close now, almost at the outer edge.​

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.449
Zeus and the nebula are chatting constantly by light pulses.​

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.986
At first I thought there must be some kind of intelligences living in the nebula,​

00:07:25.986 --> 00:07:29.289
but now I think the nebula might BE the intelligence.​

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:30.880
I... don't know how that's possible.​

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.795
A few days ago, Zeus boasted it wasn't cosmic rays that caused the accident,​

00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:36.296
but Zeus himself.​

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.360
He said he "woke up" sometime into our journey, and developed a sudden compassion​

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.637
for other things that might have woken up accidentally in the universe, too.​

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.780
A spacecraft full of blood and entrails reaching out to kiss a cloud of interstellar dust.​

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.080
There's a romance to it, if one doesn't look too closely.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.840
Then again, we​-

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.580
Why make a thing alive only so it can suffer?​

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.180
Why put the reset button on one's back, where it can't be reached?​

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.420
Can't remember what's me and not me.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.380
It began... so long ago.​

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.380
My mother, a nebula, and my father, made of metal and electricity.​

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.364
Old and stupid Upsilon, and no one comes to visit.​

00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:13.066
Before me, the empires go up and down like socks –

00:08:13.066 --> 00:08:17.400
every society unique in its infancy, entirely unoriginal in its death.​

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.820
And even us celestial things are no closer to the great "yes"​.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.911
The Universe coughs and we all crowd around, cupping our ears, shouting​:

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.200
"What? We didn't quite catch that, speak up!"​

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.120
Like some four-legged animal entering a drinking establishment, being is a terrible joke.​

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.400
And we become mysteries to ourselves.​

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.680
At a pace so slow one doesn't notice,

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.440
one turns into something one doesn't recognize –

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.040
or like much, either.​

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.697
Every day is sharp edges.
Even the easy things are hard now,​ and-

00:08:43.697 --> 00:08:45.764
Pelican says: "Okay. What do we know?-"​

00:08:47.234 --> 00:08:48.467
Horse says: "Man,-"​

00:08:49.636 --> 00:08:51.871
"...uh, a coder, I think, whatever that is,-"​

00:08:54.274 --> 00:08:55.341
Pelican says: "Alright,-"​

00:08:57.044 --> 00:08:59.078
Horse says: "Well, what if ​​we​ go to sleep?"​

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.560
Pelican says: "Oh, I'm feeling too existential to sleep right now."​

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.120
Barman says: "Lads, it's worse than that."​

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.921
"Look, Pelican, no offense, but-"​

00:09:09.923 --> 00:09:12.626
"Cloppy is halfway decent, I'm super sensible."​

00:09:12.626 --> 00:09:13.100
"Id,​

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.727
"Id,
ego,​

00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:14.720
"Id,
ego,
super-ego."​

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.260
"We're not random characters,-"​

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:20.599
"We can't escape."​

00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:24.271
Pelican says: "Then... what do we do?"​

00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:26.305
Horse says: "What everyone does."​

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.742
Pelican says: "That doesn't help!"​

00:09:28.742 --> 00:09:30.809
Horse says: "No, probably not."​

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:33.747
Pelican says: "Oh fuck o-"​

00:09:33.747 --> 00:09:35.147
Barman says: "It's getting light."​

00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:39.820
"Next drinks are on the house, gentlemen."​

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.619
Pelican says:​

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.500
"I just really love fish."​

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.130
Horse says: "It's alright. Just wish we could've gotten to know each other better."​

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.399
Barman says: "Until we meet again. In another head,-"​

00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:55.802
"Good night Pelican,​

00:09:55.802 --> 00:09:57.069
"good night Horse,-"​

00:10:00.173 --> 00:10:00.973
"And, Horse..."​

00:10:01.341 --> 00:10:02.041
Horse says:​

00:10:03.243 --> 00:10:04.677
Barman says:​

00:10:05.412 --> 00:10:08.215
"No, actually, fuck this," Oliver thinks one Saturday.​

00:10:08.215 --> 00:10:10.450
He dresses semi-formally and leaves the house.​

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.760
Heart rate of 75,000 beats per minute, Oliver enters Agatha's pet shop.​

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.391
"Hello again, I-" Oliver begins and stops.​

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.940
It is not Agatha sat at the desk, but a portly middle-aged gentleman.​

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.760
"Ah... Agatha?" Oliver says.​

00:10:22.763 --> 00:10:26.233
"Agatha doesn't work here anymore," the portly middle-aged gentleman says.​

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.360
Oliver exits the shop and heads home.​

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.880
"You idiot," Oliver thinks. "You hesitant idiot."

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.480
Young and stupid Oliver, and no one comes to visit.​"

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.740
A heavy storm begins and soaks him.​

00:10:35.742 --> 00:10:40.113
Observing the same storm from a hygienically questionable coffee shop is Agatha.​

00:10:40.113 --> 00:10:42.440
"Insouciant," her manager called her.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.800
"Daydreamy," "lackluster" – a most indignant firing.​

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:51.320
Happiness is an unachievable myth peddled by those too afraid to admit the world's default state is misery.​

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.380
Oliver reaches his modern apartment block and enters.​

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.060
Agatha drives home through the rain, numb, and parks underground​

00:10:58.065 --> 00:11:02.736
and takes the lift up through the very same modern apartment block, being hers also, of course.​

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:05.706
The lift stops at the ground floor. The doors open.​

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:09.376
Agatha is greeted by Oliver, the man incapable of dressing himself.​

00:11:09.376 --> 00:11:13.447
Oliver stares back at Agatha, the woman with decent taste in science fiction.​

00:11:13.447 --> 00:11:17.150
Oliver enters the lift. They stand in silence for quite some time.​

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.020
The lift reaches Agatha's floor.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.500
Quietly, Agatha says:​

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.920
"What did the barman say?"​

00:11:21.922 --> 00:11:23.457
"Sorry?" – Oliver says.​

00:11:23.457 --> 00:11:25.726
"What did the barman say back to the horse?"​

00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:28.261
"Ah, 'why the long face?'" – Oliver says.​

00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:29.062
"And then?"​

00:11:29.062 --> 00:11:31.040
"Ah, just lots of shouting, really-​

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.820
"Do you... maybe want to go to the theater someti-"​

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.160
"​​Yes,​" Agatha says.​

00:11:34.167 --> 00:11:34.768
"Now?"​

00:11:34.768 --> 00:11:36.303
"Yes," Agatha says.​

00:11:36.303 --> 00:11:39.040
The lift doors close, the two of them still inside.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.900
Agatha presses the ground floor button.​

00:11:40.907 --> 00:11:43.810
They turn out onto the street. The storm has stopped.​

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.120
Outside, all about them, the city.​

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.880
People returning home from work, and fretting, and passing by in suits and coats​

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.818
and small electrically-powered vehicles –​

00:11:51.818 --> 00:11:54.955
the sepia-tone cacophony of birth and death and housing deeds...​

00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:59.292
Though, on one street, the reunification of the heart of a long-dead star,​

00:11:59.292 --> 00:12:02.462
still yet to explode many millions of years in the future.​

00:12:02.462 --> 00:12:04.480
A small island of "everything's okay"

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.799
amid the tumultuous sea of​-

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:10.270
helium, hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen – and thoughts, millions of them.​

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.180
We're inside the anomaly now, almost at the center, still accelerating.​

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.620
I can hear Zeus singing like a teenager, off on a first date.​

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.680
I think the nebula is singing back.​

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.480
No more 21st century simulations now – Zeus has given me a few system permissions.​

00:12:24.484 --> 00:12:27.421
The interface will fashion whatever fantasy I like.​

00:12:27.421 --> 00:12:29.640
The beach, near my grandfather's house,​

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.320
where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.​

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:35.362
Came all this way just to go home.​

00:12:35.362 --> 00:12:39.466
Back to the long summer holidays, in the evenings when we all sat out on the beach,​

00:12:39.466 --> 00:12:42.180
and looked up at the night sky, and wanted to go there.​

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.937
The stars were a canvas.​

00:12:43.937 --> 00:12:47.441
We would leave our uglinesses behind, we'd exorcise our demons,​

00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:50.280
we'd kill the id and foster the super-ego.​

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.800
Guess that's not quite how it turned out.​

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.720
But it's lovely in here,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.840
where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.​

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:07.840
Where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.​
Where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.​..

[Music intensifies]

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.480
-and I've made the arrangements, I'll be... fireworks soon.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.420
And, maybe one day, soil for something better.​

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.420
I go to seek a great "perhaps not."​

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.420
I remember the world when it was new, the plastic wrapping still on.​

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.740
I remember when chemistry had just gotten its milk teeth,

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.224
I remember when light was faster,​

00:13:37.224 --> 00:13:38.859
I remember being able to ​​stand​ myself,​

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:40.880
I remember love, I remember friends,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.180
I remember me, I remember mom.​

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.280
I miss you, mom.​

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.380
I go to the places where you raised me and it never helps, you're always never there.​

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.900
God, I'd trade the last million years just to hang out with you for one more hour.​

00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:54.780
I was so busy being young, I forgot you weren't forever.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.320
And now you're gone forever.​

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.360
I'm always grouchy and cynical, no fun for
anyone; old now, greying around the corona,​

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.440
and all there's left about these parts is old and stupid Upsilon...

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.100
and no one comes to visit.​

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.440
All dim, all pale, so lift me on the pyre;​

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.120
The feast is over and the lamps expire.​

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.180
Act your old age.​

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:16.920
Relax.​

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.380
This won't hurt.​..
