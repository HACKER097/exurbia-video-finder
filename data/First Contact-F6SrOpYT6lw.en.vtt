00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.200
Testing...

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.140
Hellooo...

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.240
Hiiii...

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.600
Yes?

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.380
Hi, it's... It's earth. Are you-

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.020
We don't know who that is. Goodbye.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.320
No wait! We just wanted to say hello...

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.220
Is this about insurance? Because for the last time we're not fucking interested-

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.100
No, we- we thought we were alone in the universe.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.340
Oh another one of these! Yeah great.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.540
Are you like us? What's your planet like?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.320
Seriously? We're doing this are we?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.880
We're two-thirds water and we're carbon-based... Are you carbon-based?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.700
No.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.480
How does your biology work?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.559
Oh for fucks sake, look we're very busy at the moment. What do you want?

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.509
We're just, this is a really big thing for us, okay? Are there other inhabited planets as well as yours?

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.980
Yes...

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.680
How many?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.680
Are you gonna bug them as well because LV-426 is really sensitive about that kind of thing.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.720
No! We just wanted... well... can we swap knowledge or something?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.780
Jesus Christ! Have you solved quantum mechanics yet?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.040
A bit?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.480
You haven't, have you? How's your time-travel game?

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.500
Not... Not bad...

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.580
If you can't even time travel, there's no point in even-

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.900
Alright, look. We're still a bit naive at the moment

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.260
You're not fucking kidding...

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.180
But we're very ambitious. Look, we've almost cracked self-driving cars and nuclear fusion...

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.780
*muffled laughter*

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.360
What?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.940
*cough* Oh no, no nothing very, very clever. Very clever go on.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.240
Look, we just want a bit of help.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.440
*other voice* Who's that? Is it about insurance!?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.160
No, they're called Earth, they can't even do time travel!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.600
*cough* Alright, yeah, sorry, what do you want exactly?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.520
Well, could you give us a bit of... technology... maybe?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.200
Alright, look, time-travel's pretty easy, okay? Can you make gravitons yet?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.200
Y-yes...?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.420
Oh, for fuck's-  well, you can make anti-matter at least, right?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.100
Oh yeah we're really great at that one we've got-

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.020
Okay, you're gonna need about a kilogram.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.020
A- a kilogram?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.620
Yes. Is that gonna be a problem?

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.000
No, we, we just... alright... go on.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.940
And you've got particle colliders now, right?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.020
Yeah loads of them and we're going to-

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.500
Good. You're going to want to run them on anti-matter now.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.900
Fine. Go on.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.720
Good. Now you're going to want to turn your colliders up to about 500 tetravolts.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.140
That seems a little... high?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.580
Oooh, sorry. We didn't realize we're talking to a planet entirely populated by sentient pussies.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.040
Alright... 500 tetravolts...

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.600
Great, now you want to fire the beam straight down into your planet's core.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600
Into the- is that... safe?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.080
Extremely safe, yes.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.700
Because that doesn't sound.. particularly safe...

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.120
Do you want to time travel or not?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.700
Alright, alright, look, it's just... a few scientists here have some reservations about all of this...

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.360
Hey guys!

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.500
H- hi, is that another planet?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.860
Yes?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.580
Are you going to introduce us?

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.840
*sigh* Arrakis this is Earth, Earth, Arrakis.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.300
Hey man! So... what are you guys up to?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.180
We're teaching Earth how to time-travel.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.500
Yeah, with anti-mater!

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.240
With anti- right... okay.. well... carry on with that...

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.460
Anyway, so you have to aim it right down into the center of the planet, okay?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.040
Okay.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.480
Yeah, right into your planet's core *laughter*

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.260
What's that?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.760
Nothing...

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.320
Nothing! He didn't say anything, carry on!

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.080
Wait... how does this even work?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.120
Just do it. Arrakis will think you're really cool.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.690
Yeah. Yeah, really cool

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.860
We don't know if this is what Col Sagan had in mind exactly...

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.980
Less talking more time travel.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.340
All right, well, we've got the kilogram of antimatter, so we just...

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.520
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.940
Yes, do it now.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.060
You're sure about this? It's... oh, it's getting pretty hot around here...

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.800
No, no, that's, that's fine.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.580
Perfectly safe! *laughter*

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.000
It's wow... all the ice caps are melting and Norway just disappeared is that normal?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.100
*laughter* Yeah! Yeah, fine. Fine. Yeah. Carry on.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.940
Oh, God and the... and the sky's collapsing and-

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.760
*laughter*

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.160
Oh God....

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.940
Huh... it's not as satisfying as I thought it would be...

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.940
No I know...

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.540
Anyway, you want to come over on Saturday? I'm having Alderaan over for drinks.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.740
Yeah about Alderaan... umm... listen mate I've got a bit of bad news.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.580
Oh God what is it?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.340
Oh hi guys!

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.340
What!? What the hell!? Where have you been, exactly?

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.060
Yeah the antimatter thing worked out really well actually. We're gods now so we thought we'd just go ahead and conquer the known galaxy actually.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.060
OH FUCK
