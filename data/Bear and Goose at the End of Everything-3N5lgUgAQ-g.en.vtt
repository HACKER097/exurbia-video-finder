00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.120
Billions of years after the great galactic empires have peaked and science was finished. The stars began to die and no new ones were made.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.160
and somewhere in a remote patch of space a bear came upon a goose.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.320
"Hello," Bear said, "do we know each other?"

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.680
"I don't think so," Goose said.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.550
"Well, Which civilization do you come from?"

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.900
"I don't remember what they're called," Goose said, "I think they had a few wars and watched TV every now And then, I guess"

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.600
"Yeah," Bear said, "that sounds like my civilization, too. Is yours gone as well?"

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.900
"Well they're all gone," Goose said, "we're the last ones left don't you know."

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.680
Bear looked out at the universe and knew goose was right. All the nebulas were coming apart. All the galaxies were withering.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.020
"How long do we have," Bear said.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.320
"Oh, not long," goose replied, "Very soon now the universe will collapse back in on itself"

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.160
"Huh," bear said, "what happens then?"

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.000
"Oh, Everything will be gone," Goose said, "no more walking, no more fun, no more swimming."

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.340
"C'est la vie mÃ©nage toi (So it goes)"

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.540
"huh," bear said again, "What was your civilization like?"

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.440
"Hmm," goose said. She pointed with her wing

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.040
"You see that star, my whole civilization began there. And that galaxy, they spread through the whole thing. Made music, wrote books,

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:15.959
married, divorced, lived, died, had wars, apologized, had wars, blew everything up. A billion years of Empire, millions of languages,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.360
thousands of planets, and now... all gone"

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.780
"All gone," Bear echoed.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.920
"And how about yours?" goose said.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.699
"Well, my civilization discovered the workings of nature, knew how it was all put together, saw the logic in the chaos, built enormous

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.629
Starships, traded with thousands of other empires, traveled the entire cosmos, learned everything there was to learn, then came right back to where they started,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.790
saw everything, gave up."

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.290
"Pity," goose said, "anyway the end will be here soon. It's been lovely chatting"

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.539
Goose closed her eyes and was silent. Bear looked out again at the dying universe and felt very sad

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.060
"What was it all for?" he said finally.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.500
"What?" goose said.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.579
"What was the point?"

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.089
"Oh, what's the point in anything," goose said. She closed her eyes again

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.189
An idea came to bear: "We know everything," bear said, "everything our civilizations knew"

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.000
"Sure," goose said.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.640
"And we can do anything, we're all powerful."

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.200
"Well,. within limits."

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.820
"Well, Why don't we remake the universe?"

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.020
"Well that's impossible," goose said, "we couldn't survive the collapse, It's very close now

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.280
It's Just over there"

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.300
"Well, then we'll set the next universe up properly for whoever comes after"

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.620
Goose opened her eyes. "like how?"

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.140
"Well I don't know, make it more interesting, change the rules a bit. Come on, they'll never know. It'll be fun."

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.220
Goose considered this idea, she was very clever after all. Under different circumstances

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.109
She might have gone on TV talking about astrophysical matters, Neil Degoose Tyson perhaps

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.900
"All right," Goose said, "I'm listening."

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.940
"Well," bear said, "let's make everything based on subatomic particles this time. We'll call them..."

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.420
"quacks," goose said.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.980
"hmm, a bit silly: quarks, how about that."

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.920
"Fair compromise," goose said.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.900
Bear began setting up the new universe.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.080
"And will make olives taste nice this time!"

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.260
"Okay, Good idea"

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.599
"And fruit will grow on trees"

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.960
"Sounds good"

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.189
"And every now and then after a good meal people will throw up a bit in their own mouths"

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.440
"What?" Goose said, "why?"

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.320
"I don't know, it'll be funny."

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.679
"Don't put that in," Goose said.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.820
Bear put it in.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.180
Then he organized physics and chemistry and biology and made them all interact, and built in emerging properties, invented quantum field theory

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.980
and debugged everything and added some DLC

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.670
He made water wet and deserts dry and Tom Hanks impossible to dislike and finally he was done

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.160
They marveled at the starting conditions of their new universe.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.169
"It's still missing something," bear said, "Should we maybe add more purple"

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.680
"No, it doesn't need more purple," Goose said.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.200
"Hey, maybe coffee should make everyone shit real bad."

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.979
"Don't put that in," Goose said

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.020
Bear put it in.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.660
"There," he said, "perfect, let's get this sucker going."

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.359
"No wait," Goose said, "we're still missing something"

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.900
"We've got to make things... difficult."

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.920
"Difficult?" Bear said, "no

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.179
We'll make this the party cosmos: margaritas on trees, walking hamburgers that kind of thing"

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.829
"No," goose said, "look where that got our civilizations. Everything was boring, It was too easy"

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.239
"We'll make living tricky, but not too tricky. That way there'll be a point, at least for a while"

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.260
"We'll make the stars so far away, they'd have to get clever to reach them."

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.640
"We'll make nature just weird enough to be interesting, but not so weird they can't crack it"

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.960
"And we can't put the meaning of life in plain sight, it'll have to be a challenge"

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.219
"They'll need to fall in love or go backpacking or argue in the comments section of YouTube or something"

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.380
"All right," bear said. And made the changes.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.409
They sat back then and admired their blueprint of the cosmos-to-be, no one could doubt that it was indeed: very pretty

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.500
Around them the stars were going out in bunches, now the light was dying. Infinite space was reclaiming its territory

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.020
"Is this it?" Bear said.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.860
"This is it," goose replied.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.220
"What will happen to us now?"

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.560
"Oh, we'll be gone, everything will be gone, then the new universe will start just how we designed it"

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.529
The darkness came down in silent curtains all around them. History was dying. Space gave a little whimper. The end was just moments away

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.619
"Goose, I'm scared," Bear said

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.450
"I know, Bear," Goose said,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.170
"But it won't hurt, here put my wing in your paw and don't let go"

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.589
The last star died finally. Then space began to collapse into a point infinitely small, the laws of physics blurring into each other.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.320
Time and space falling undone. Billions of years had come to this and soon it would be for nothing at all.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.360
[Music Swells]

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.640
[The music fades to silence]

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.720
"Will they see?" Bear said, "In the next cycle, do you think they'll see how beautiful everything is."

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.340
"Sometimes," Goose said, "Only sometimes. All the time would be too much. Never would be too little.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.180
"Every now and then. They'll see it sometimes"

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.980
"and that will be enough..."

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.800
Amazing as always, exurb1a

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.200
Have a great day Y'all!
