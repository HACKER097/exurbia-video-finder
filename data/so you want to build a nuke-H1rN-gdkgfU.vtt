00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.040
[Music]

00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.359
so you want to build a nuke eh well

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.799
for that you need some uranium uranium

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.679
is a radioactive element

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.800
it has many uses including curing cancer

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.559
generating power

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.240
and making people immediately stop

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.839
[ __ ] existing anyway

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.680
once you've mined some uranium you'll

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.920
need to enrich it why

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.920
because isotopes if you vary the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.960
neutrons in an element you get different

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.720
cosplay versions

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.720
of that element and the version we want

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.119
here is uranium-235

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.800
because it's good in bonds and [ __ ] so

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.559
it's off to the centrifuges for some

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.399
wizzy fun time and soon you'll have

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.000
shiny apocalypse cookies before you can

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.440
say nuclear holocaust

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.960
and if you're still serious about

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.840
building this thing we'll need to talk

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.239
about fission

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.399
and fusion thanks to this smoking hot

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.760
piece of physicist booty we now know you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.760
can make a little bit of mass

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.039
into a lot of energy and one way of

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.960
doing that is via

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.120
fission fission is when you give big

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.399
atomic nuclei a bonk and convert them

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.239
into smaller nuclei

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.640
and you get loads of energy from that

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.800
it's how nuclear reactors work and also

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.800
bombs fusion is the reverse of that

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.920
basically when nuclei combine

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.600
it's how the sun works and also bombs in

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.439
a fission bomb the goal is to get the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.680
uranium to release neutrons

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.119
one can do this via explosives or

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.960
claiming to have engaged in sexual

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.640
intercourse with the uranium's mother

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.560
these neutrons will hit the unstable

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.720
nuclei of the rest of the uranium

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.159
and at that point well whatever argument

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.560
it was that led you to detonate this

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.119
thing

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.000
let's just say you won that one but if

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.320
you're really pissed

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.360
off then you'll need a fusion bomb this

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.439
is a double whammy

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.280
the first stage is fission then switches

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.840
to fusion creating essentially

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.000
a star on earth anyway that's your nuke

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.759
built so it's off to the races baby

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.360
well we'll need somewhere quiet to test

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.840
it out how's about somewhere near the

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.759
hornado de nueto desert in new mexico

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.040
lovely little spot for a picnic make

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.439
sure to bring some jam

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.520
those little triangular sandwiches and a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.759
crippling certainty that thanks to you

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.640
humankind will forevermore be held

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.399
hostage

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.680
by itself the first ever nuclear device

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.320
is detonated on july 16th 1945

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.200
codename trinity the device explodes

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.239
with the equivalent power of 22 000 tons

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.599
of tnt later robert oppenheimer the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.760
father of the atomic bomb

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.720
will say i remember the line from the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.239
hindu scripture

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.720
the baha'i vagita now i am become death

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.360
the destroyer of worlds just under a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.959
month later the b-29 and nola gay will

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.440
drop the fish and bomb little boy

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.680
over the japanese city of hiroshima it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.239
will explode with the power of 15 000

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.959
tons

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.440
of tnt above will preside a mushroom

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.800
cloud

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.319
60 000 feet high below 70 000 people

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.239
are immediately incinerated and

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.160
mutilated by a shock wave traveling

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.760
faster than the speed of sound

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.599
thousands of people who are not killed

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.959
in the initial blast will be exposed to

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.800
ionizing radiation

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.080
suffering the effects for decades to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800
come hemorrhaging

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.280
cancer and genetic mutations three days

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.200
later

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.360
a second bomb called fat man will be

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.000
dropped on the seaport of nagasaki

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.319
at least 60 000 people will be killed

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.760
japan will surrender three weeks later

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.360
and the governments of the world will

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.519
almost unanimously agree

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.640
that this must never happen again not

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.120
intentionally

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.120
not by accident not by ignorance

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.000
in 1947 the bulletin of the atomic

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.840
scientists devised a doomsday

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.599
clock with midnight representing

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.159
absolute global catastrophe

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.799
today the clock stands at 100 seconds to

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.799
midnight

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.840
pretty bad but frankly it's hard to see

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.200
what they're getting their little lab

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.519
coats in a twist about eh

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.280
world war ii was ages ago the threat of

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.319
nuclear war is long gone

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.239
other than wow okay in 1961

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.560
several four megaton nukes might have

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.280
slightly fallen out of a b-52 over north

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.560
carolina

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.159
one of which narrowly avoided

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.799
destinating because of a single safety

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.560
switch

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.159
but okay other than that well in 1962 a

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.680
soviet patrol submarine might have

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.519
slightly lost contact with the land

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.360
the captain assuming world war iii had

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.680
already started and was about to fire a

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.000
10

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.519
kiloton nuke torpedo at a nearby u.s

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.560
fleet before the flotilla commander

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.439
could calm him down

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.760
and maybe 1967 when a solar flare took

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.280
out a few norad radars the us might have

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.640
slightly freaked out and almost launched

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.680
a bomber counter-strike against the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.400
soviet union

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.000
then 1969 north korea shot down a u.s

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.160
radar surveillance plane president

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.519
richard nixon allegedly drunk gave the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.400
order for a nuclear strike in

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.400
retaliation

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.840
luckily henry kissinger stepped in and

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.560
we're still here

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.560
or just the entire cold war basically 40

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.240
years of unrelenting nuclear panic

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.400
and then you remember the precarious

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.520
state of mutually assured destruction

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.759
which is well when a mummy country and a

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.280
daddy country hate each other very much

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.800
sometimes they get embroiled in a

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.560
nuclear standoff and

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.160
one little deterrent against pushing the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.680
button is the knowledge that in the time

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.080
it takes for your missiles to reach your

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.759
enemy

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.360
your enemy will have kindly fired theirs

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.960
back at you the idea

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.479
is that if you're rational neither of

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.080
you are going to strike first

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.759
until you remember that humans are not

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.040
rational we are i believe the

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.440
anthropological term is

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.040
[ __ ] morons currently nine countries

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.360
have nukes that's the us

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.880
russia france my homeland of crumpets

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.280
and self-hate pakistan

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.240
india israel the uppity korea and of

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.680
course china

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.440
and that's not to mention several

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.720
countries probably have hypersonic

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.800
nuclear missiles now

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.759
which can fly upwards of five times the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.600
speed of sound

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.120
rendering modern missile defense systems

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.400
about as effective as putting up a

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.160
little sign that says

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.400
ah don't newcast mate you said you

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.720
wouldn't what are you doing you said you

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.240
wouldn't why are you oh for [ __ ] sake

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.560
you're such a dick

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.560
or rather if these puppies launch in the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.280
words of the motto of the us postal

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.240
service

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.560
neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.039
of night shall stay these couriers from

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.160
swift completion of their appointed

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.400
rounds

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.520
it's a hundred seconds to midnight baby

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.600
nuclear armageddon

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.000
ain't gone anywhere the cold war ended

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.520
in 91 but the real war the silent war

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.680
has only just started because we

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.680
discovered a 23rd century technology in

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.800
the 20th century and we're too primitive

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.800
for this ship right now

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.080
and ironically nukes are so prevalent in

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.840
entertainment and media that we've

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.600
almost forgotten this is real that if we

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.199
aren't constantly vigilant apocalypse

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.680
could happen any time and it will be the

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.759
end of

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.280
everything including possibly the only

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.919
instance of life anywhere in the

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.759
universe

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.039
all just because of some mental general

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.600
or [ __ ] dictator

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.440
as einstein allegedly said i know not

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.000
with what weapons world war 3 will be

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.000
fought

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.840
but world war 4 will be fought with

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.840
sticks and stones

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.759
anyway have a lovely week won't you
