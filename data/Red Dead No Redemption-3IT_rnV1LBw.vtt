00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.520
if you were choosing a house and one was

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.559
open plan had picturesque views 57

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.000
million square miles of land five oceans

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.199
a breathable atmosphere and meerkats and

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.840
the other house was a barren hellscape

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.480
with poisonous soil a poisonous

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.119
atmosphere a constant barrage of deadly

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.199
cosmic radiation and zero mere cats

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.039
i mean you'd pick the nice one right

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.120
because you spent millions of years

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.920
evolving to live there and there's land

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.280
galore and plenty of resources and if

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.440
you treat it properly it could be a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.360
veritable paradise with humans and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.480
nature living in perfect heart where the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.000
[ __ ] are you going

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.079
but if you really insist on visiting

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.680
mars then we'll have to get there so

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.520
spacey school first where you'll be

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.360
treated to a variety of psychologists in

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.120
your brain and a variety of cameras up

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.640
your ass then a ride up through the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.399
atmosphere on a barely controlled

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.320
explosion bomb voyage

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.480
off we go then unless your spaceship

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.239
uses spinny sci-fi rings welcome to zero

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.360
gravity meaning you can now look forward

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.119
to space adaptation syndrome or science

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.880
your precious bodily fluids will now

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.320
redistribute and puff your head up your

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.159
lunch will probably pop out of your

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.680
tummy for a second viewing your spine

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.439
will now begin to stretch out by a few

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.880
centimeters let's see how that goes when

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.479
you get back to gravity and maybe

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.479
debilitating kidney stones from your

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.040
bones losing calcium and cancerous

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.759
radiation from cosmic rays we are not

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.240
made for space on average mars is about

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.159
142 million miles from earth but every

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.000
26 months it gets close enough for

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.520
humans to pop across traveling with

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.680
current tech that'll probably take

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.600
around seven months and during that time

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.920
all of your food will be eaten from bags

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.240
no booze obviously and let's just hope

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.720
you like drinking recycled pierce as the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.960
nasa motto goes today's coffee is

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.439
tomorrow's coffee but that's not all

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.040
because confinement you now inescapably

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.960
share a double decker bus with a bunch

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.119
of potentially highly irritating humans

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.719
for the next seven months on top of that

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.399
all you have to look out the window at

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.240
is little oodle doodles on a black

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.240
background interspersed with occasional

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.320
breaks for a nice cup of piss java on

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.720
top of that medical problems dental

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.560
issues unexpected space pregnancy the

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.400
nearest hospital is millions of miles

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.840
back the way you came but assuming

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.360
you've avoided technical failure

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.680
psychological failure deadly

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.920
micrometeoroids hopefully you've made it

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.400
to mars pick a nice spot for landing and

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.160
prepare for 10 minutes of terror even

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.239
though the atmosphere of mars is about

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.000
100 times less dense than earth's that

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.680
means it's enough to burn stuff up but

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.840
not thick enough to make parachutes very

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.680
effective you'll need some variation of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.599
an aeroshell to protect the spacecraft

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.680
booty a parachute to slow things down a

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.760
bit and probably retro rockets to get to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.080
the surface undead and if you still

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.000
haven't gone mad sad or irradiated and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.920
you sat down alright best of luck

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.160
standing up you've just got used to zero

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.080
gravity and now gravity is back the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.760
world will go 10 tequila shots wibbly

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.360
with your eyes fighting your vestibular

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.680
system your body thinks it's been

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.519
poisoned vertigo and horrific nausea

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.200
could go on for weeks but if you can

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.360
power through snap a blueprint on the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.599
martian surface for us idiots back home

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.920
10 points to gryffindor humanity has

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.879
gone interplanetary that's one small

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.599
step for a suicidal astronaut one giant

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.000
leap for whoever happens to be into big

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.519
barren balls of sweet

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.840
[ __ ] all

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.840
because that's where you are now

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.239
great you've made the history books but

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.840
that ain't gonna keep you alive now

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.000
maybe some robots went ahead of you and

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.200
got a little crib ready maybe not but

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.440
either way you'll need your own

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.080
breathable air because mars don't have

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.400
that mars's atmosphere is 95 carbon

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.879
dioxide that's the stuff we breathe out

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.360
not in three percent nitrogen or plant

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.000
food you are not a plant and two percent

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.840
ago argon now maybe you can make oxygen

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.680
from carbon dioxide using a process

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.200
called electrolysis but that is going to

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.720
take lots of power and unless you

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.040
brought a nuclear reactor with you or

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.040
something good luck anyway duties of

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.879
yours will probably include scouting the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.799
area for prime real estate for those who

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.760
come after you a spot of geology

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.519
geography and trying not to die and get

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.920
a load of your new hood the tallest

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.840
volcano in the solar system olympus mons

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.000
the largest canyon in the solar system

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.439
valles marineris and hope your beach

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.840
body is ready because maximum

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.439
temperature is 30 degrees celsius hope

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.919
your beach coffin is ready because

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.160
minimum is -140

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.320
a mars day is only 37 minutes longer

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
than ours there'll also be four seasons

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.320
just like earth and feel free to step

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.000
outside and die in any of them oh watch

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.919
out for dust storms they can get 20

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.160
miles high and spread across the entire

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.199
planet for months on end the greeks

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.040
called mars's two moons fear and panic

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.720
and there's a reason for that

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.639
now we think there's still frozen water

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.400
on mars maybe liquid water deep under

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.080
the surface hopefully you found some of

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.240
that and hopefully it isn't full of

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.800
deadly lurking pathogens talking of

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.960
which old martian water might mean old

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.040
martian life and how exciting if you

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.600
found some of that possibly yeah

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.040
possibly [ __ ] no because if the remains

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.040
of life are found there's two

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.199
possibilities either we confirm that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.120
it's an ancient ancestor of earth life

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.199
meaning somehow we swapped microbes with

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.520
mars ages ago and we're all descended

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.199
from the same stuff interesting for sure

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.000
or there's no connection to earth

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.680
meaning it's really real alien life and

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.479
one massive thing we don't know about

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.800
the universe is how common is life just

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.120
arising in the first place well if the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.039
remains of alien life even microbes are

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.960
found on mars that means life began

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.840
independently on two out of eight

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.639
planets in our solar system alone or one

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.400
in four pretty good odds and if we apply

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.080
those odds to the rest of the universe

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.320
there are probably at least thousands of

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.840
earth-like planets in our galaxy alone

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.840
billions considering all the other

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.800
galaxies and that's nice and that's

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.240
swell but if life is so common where is

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.400
everyone then where is anyone well maybe

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.800
alien life doesn't evolve into complex

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.720
organisms very often or maybe it does

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.400
but civilizations wipe themselves out

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.800
with some technology waiting for us a

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.280
few hundred years into our own future or

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.960
maybe someone is meticulously wiping

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.120
them out something to rustle the

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.720
existential jimmies in any case still

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.039
your launch window will come around in a

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.880
few months off your trot the next lot of

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.400
human parasites to arrive might start

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.960
thinking about actually sticking around

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.360
for a while as in permanent digs and for

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.919
them radiation will be a big issue

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.080
courtesy of the sun and cosmic rays all

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.400
things being equal humans on mars would

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.800
receive 50 times as much radiation as

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.720
they would living on earth lava tubes

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.560
could be an idea they're underground

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.639
that'll help there might be some decent

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.880
ones at a spot called halas planeta for

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.639
example and if humans can seal a section

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.800
off and pressurize it and with the help

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.759
of a nuclear reactor oxygen extraction

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.080
from the atmosphere etc yeah maybe

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:44.560
alternately mars is covered in crushed

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.319
rock regolith everywhere we don't know

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.759
yet if you can make durable concrete

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:50.639
from the stuff would be neat for

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.240
building with but again radiation so

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.479
some kind of protective shell would be

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.919
needed if humans are living up top and

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.440
covering everything in a layer of

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.759
regolith might do the trick for

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.319
shielding solar and cosmic nasties in

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.400
any case underground overground wombling

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.720
free if humans can find enough power

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.960
water and protection from radiation it

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.880
won't be pretty living but maybe for

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.960
whatever god forsaken reason anyone

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.720
would live on mars it could be home

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.039
[Music]

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.759
now making babies on mars will not be a

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.599
problem there's enough gravity for that

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.360
having babies though

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.599
god knows what happens to a developing

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.759
fetus on mars if conception is even

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.759
possible but this is all made up anyway

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.599
so assuming radiation hasn't damaged the

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.080
mum or child during gestation

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.479
congratulations it's a martian the first

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.560
one ever and just by being born he or

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:42.800
she will perhaps instantly become one of

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.039
the most famous humans ever to exist

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.960
talk about peaking early now mars is

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:48.960
unlikely to be a state by then so if

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.639
maritime law applies he or she will

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.639
probably inherit the citizenship of

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:54.319
their parents all the same the first

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:56.479
ever native martian will no doubt be

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:59.440
adorable in that irritating baby way

00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:01.360
tiny feetsies tiny hands but with bones

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.440
and a heart that will develop in martian

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.360
gravity just 38

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.440
of earth's they may never be able to

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.280
visit earth not without some miraculous

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.840
technology our gravity will be

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.759
exhausting possibly fatal but if you're

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.199
of a certain age you know what happens

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:17.520
when one of your mates has a baby

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:19.199
suddenly everyone wants one resource

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.280
permitting here come more little

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:23.759
martians then living effectively in a

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.759
submarine is all they will know and

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:28.080
they'll be told stories of course of

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:30.879
another planet just over there somewhere

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.599
with oceans and zebras and skyscrapers

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:35.519
all beneath a benevolent blue sky this

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:37.279
will also probably signal a change in

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:39.440
the colony from survivalists to

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:41.680
homesteaders they need teachers now and

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.039
pediatricians and pharmacologists to

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.560
cook up whatever brand of liquid

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.240
morphine it is that stops new parents

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.480
going [ __ ] postal they're

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.480
generational they're a proper settlement

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.040
and hopefully with enough fertilizer and

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.800
detoxification martian soil can support

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.959
a crop yield to foster a growing

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.959
population who knows and what do

00:08:56.959 --> 00:09:00.640
martians do all day anyway why would

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:03.040
earth have funded a martian operation

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.120
for so long it really depends on what we

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.360
find there if rare resources are

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.120
abundant mining and export could be an

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.040
option mars has less than half the

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.880
gravity of earth and if rocket fuel can

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.200
be made in abundance interplanetary

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.800
logistics mars to earth would be way

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.480
cheaper than the other way around

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.640
asteroid mining also wouldn't be the

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.880
worst idea if we're going all sci-fi

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.040
between jupiter and mars is our solar

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.720
system's main asteroid belt it's only

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.519
about four percent the mass of earth's

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.680
moon but full of iron and nickel cobalt

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:33.360
vibranium billions and billions of

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.440
dollars worth of materials and

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.360
considering mars is closer and again

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.600
easier to launch stuff into orbit from

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.839
could be the basis of an economy maybe

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.440
but whatever happens next really depends

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:45.519
on whether martians can achieve energy

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.680
independence from earth if they're

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:49.839
forever relying on us for isotopes or

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.600
materials they'll forever be a satellite

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:53.680
of the mother planet if they don't have

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.920
to though that would be interesting

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.320
because they're 20 minutes away by radio

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.480
and months away by rocket and if you

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.360
leave isolated settlers in one place

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.680
they do what humans always do culture

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.760
inventing new dialects new traditions

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.920
and with that a sense of independent

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.079
martian solidarity they probably have

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.160
their own flag and catchy anthems about

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:15.440
how mars is best this planet perhaps

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.720
they'll start having little chats

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.480
amongst themselves about how they're

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.399
getting bored with the earth supervision

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.399
thing but we know what happens when a

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:23.920
distant state or multinational has an

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:25.839
isolated group of people just where it

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.839
wants them and the issue of independence

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:29.920
gets raised the reply from corporate

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:31.760
usually goes something like listen you

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.440
just keep doing or producing or

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.519
exporting whatever it is of yours we

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.360
like so much and in return you'll be

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:39.440
more than fairly compensated with a tea

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.839
break once a year and pitifully small

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.760
payment if any at all and even more

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:45.519
brutal working conditions and if you

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.519
don't like it feel free to eat that big

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:49.920
bag of dicks over there and every now

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:52.160
and then if sufficiently irate perhaps

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.079
these isolated people respond thanks

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.320
that sounds great small digression

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:58.320
though about the tea it's lovely with

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.200
lemon but yeah we prefer it in the

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.279
boston harbour yeah [ __ ] 15 bucks

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.120
little man pay us fair and insert your

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:07.760
resolute trading company right up your

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.680
fundament we want meerkats and passports

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.120
and [ __ ] loads of meerkats we'll found

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.640
our own martian government with our own

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.320
parliamentary shouty people and

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.079
everything and we'll do democracy better

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.680
we'll do brutality better we'll [ __ ]

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:19.760
everything up better than you ever could

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.360
no one's had a bath in three generations

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.760
so take your quarterly reports and your

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.320
taxation without representation and [ __ ]

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:29.839
right off yep ocean hogging atmosphere

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.839
breathing cuts

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:40.720
they grow up so fast

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:43.040
[Music]

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.959
about three billion years ago when the

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.680
human race was a mere twinkle in

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:50.480
darwin's eye it's likely that mars had

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.880
an ocean over time the planetary core

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.360
cooled and the great magnet at the heart

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.600
of the world shut down and without a

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.920
magnetic field for protection solar

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.079
winds began to attack stripping away the

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.279
atmosphere while the water below was

00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:08.880
evaporated as life flourished next door

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:11.200
for 3000 million years but if we make

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.440
the trip there sometime soon though the

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.480
first settlers to mars may arrive in

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:20.079
hell they would surely prefer eden can

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.240
we do that can we bring a planet back

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:25.200
from the dead

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.360
well no probably not us we're barely

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.760
managing the house we grew up in but our

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.839
kids kids kids might give it a go if the

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.920
technology is there for starters they

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:37.360
would need to recreate mars's long dead

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.839
magnetic field its magnetosphere and one

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.399
fun and pleasantly insane idea for this

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:44.720
is engineering a taurus or donut of

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:47.680
plasma around the planet by firing off

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.680
particles from phobos mars's larger moon

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.160
but this stuff is all probably science

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.000
for later this century or the next and

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.680
even with magnetic shielding the

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.680
atmosphere is thinner than airline

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.320
toilet paper and too chilly for humans

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.279
anyway well a bit of global warming then

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.360
co2 and cfcs are terrible for our

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:07.440
atmosphere but released into mars

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.920
atmosphere by the kiloton would be one

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.320
way to thicken and warm things up but

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.120
even then if the air is nice and toasty

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.880
we still can't breathe it cyanobacteria

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.440
gifted earth with oxygen via

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.519
photosynthesis but that took millions

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.519
and millions of years even if

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:25.839
cyanobacteria is capable of living on

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:28.000
mars or genetically engineered algae or

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:30.079
something making mars air breathable

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.800
with photosynthesis is likely to take

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:35.760
centuries if not a millennium if not

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.839
longer though if it's possible perhaps

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.760
as back on earth we grimly mark the

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:42.480
successive milestones of environmental

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.600
decline our martian cousins will watch

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:48.000
their world for the opposite

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.000
the first cloud the first reigns the

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.160
first blade of grass and anthill the

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.600
first lover's picnic outside the first

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.920
martian generation to consider

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.560
themselves not as stalwart settlers but

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.560
earth's equals full terraforming may

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.320
just not be possible some areas of

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.079
science are dead ends there's a reason

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.000
alchemy jobs are so hard to come by

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:08.160
these days but from our current vantage

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.720
point in history there is a case for the

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.800
possibility of resurrecting mars and

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.199
wherever else humans of the solar system

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.120
go whatever else we turn into however

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:19.519
much better or worse human existence

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.680
becomes with any kind of permanent

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:23.920
self-sufficient settlement on mars a

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.720
single delicate cell of planetary

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.639
civilization will have divided in two

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.600
with the terrible burden of cosmic

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:34.240
survival carried on two backs now making

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.399
the weight lighter for both

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.760
there's a good bit near the end of the

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:42.880
movie 2010 when the story is almost

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.800
wrapped up and non-corporeal omnipotent

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.079
aliens deign to communicate with

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.360
humanity just once a message addressed

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:52.720
to all of us

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:56.240
and paraphrased the message reads

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.720
all these worlds are yours

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.839
use them together

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.560
use them

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:02.560
in peace

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.720
hi thanks for staying until the bitter

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.959
end i wrote a story a while ago called

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.800
geometry for ocelots and just a mere

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:19.040
year after the ebook came out it's a

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.720
paperback now too there's a link below

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.959
if you want to get hold of the paperback

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.360
there's a link below if you don't it

00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:28.000
works equally well as a doorstop a

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.759
beverage mat and perhaps a tarpaulin for

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.320
any itinerant mice passing through your

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:34.000
premises it's a thousand-year long war

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.839
between a religious empire and a
