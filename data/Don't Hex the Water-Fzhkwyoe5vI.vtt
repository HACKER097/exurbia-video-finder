00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.040
on the mountain is the Eternal City of

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.200
anteriori the place where there are no

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.380
secrets and while the citizens do not

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.179
smile so much they hardly frown either

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.280
jewels and objects of great worth lie in

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.020
the streets for there is no theft where

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.900
there are no secrets and there are no

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.640
secrets in anteriori long ago during the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680
war of magical technology the city

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.420
sheltered a great wizard and in return

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.000
for the city's kindness the wizard

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.099
Enchanted the water of interior such

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.439
that one need only stare into the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.360
reflection of a puddle or wash basin and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.520
ask after a personal Place one should

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.280
like to see and be shown that thing in

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.379
its entirety it's not spying spying is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420
an exclusive activity and since anyone

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.399
can watch anyone this is simply how the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.520
anterians live they have no word for

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.379
secrecy life was turbulent at first the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.059
whispered slight to the bath house the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.340
swindles of the marketplace suddenly

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.960
watchable for all plus crime rings and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.879
crooked politicians could be listened in

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.859
on at the moment's notice illicit love

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.980
affairs observed by anyone sufficiently

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.480
voyeuristic but the was made recent

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.700
Generations have grown up with no

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.799
concepts of concealment and do not seem

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.080
to suffer for it everything is visible

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.880
in the water even the most mundane acts

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.799
the brushing of one's teeth the Brewing

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.200
of one's tea is performed with attention

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.479
and flare for anyone and everyone may be

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.000
watching there is nothing hidden every

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.700
eye is all seeing and all

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560
but anteriori's transparency is not for

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.900
everyone and for those who cannot bear

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.420
such a way of life far below by the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.000
ocean swaddled always in fog is the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.040
Eternal City of tinagrat the place where

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.900
there are only Secrets the citizens

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.119
don't frown so much but they hardly

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.979
smile either possessions are many and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.140
doors are unlocked since there is no

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.880
desire unfulfilled in tinagrad and there

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.640
is no thefts where there is no desire

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.979
unfulfilled for it was here long ago the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.960
great wizard first went for shelter and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.180
was refused and to thank the people of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.740
tinagrass for their apathy he returned

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
to the conclusion of the war and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.000
Enchanted the water here too the wet fog

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.700
that permeates every street and house

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.799
the snow that thaws come spring though

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.840
while the water in tinagrad sees all

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.940
citizens have no access to its

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.459
omniscient Visions there is only one

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.379
Watcher out of the bedrooms wear glasses

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.540
on nightstands listen of those mumbled

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.520
Untold Secrets the Tiner gradients admit

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.200
in their sleep down the cobbled stones

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.940
where the puddles watch of land disputes

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.520
and unrequited love to the harbor where

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.980
the ocean silently records of overpriced

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.319
fish and drunken Barb rules out into the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.480
bay where there resides a great Kraken

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.060
who watches the Kraken never sleeps

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.280
never falters his mind unjudging as a

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.860
seismograph and the Kraken is very

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.840
hungry and its favorite meal is Secrets

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.300
as delivered by the water to its

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.640
unblinking eyes the secrets of tinagrat

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.500
each impulse and desire of each citizen

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.959
such that they may be met if favorable

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.220
to the market or suppressed if not such

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.959
that at the slightest hint of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.760
eccentricity citizens may be placed

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.459
under heightened surveillance such that

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.260
none need ever fear or want and in

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.420
return for this miracle of constant

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.700
safety and satisfaction all the Kraken

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.700
requires is a little knowledge and all

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.440
it wants to know is everything give me

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.420
your tired thoughts your poor decisions

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.980
your huddled missives yearning to be

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.420
free who have you been going to bed with

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.040
who would you like to go to bed with

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.540
thinking of starting a family thinking

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.099
of cutting off your family preferred

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.680
brand of breakfast cereal least favorite

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.300
season what does home mean to you and if

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.040
the miracle should falter for a second

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.780
and a citizen-like catch sight of a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.540
great hungry eye peering from the water

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.700
and cry out these are secrets my secrets

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.099
and my secrets are all I have the Kraken

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.440
only replies you ungrateful little

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.540
insect for what pretty things I have

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.180
sold you what peace times I have

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.840
delivered you what love I have shown you

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.840
what

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.640
is privacy for how do we resist the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.560
increasingly aggressive attempts to

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.480
remove it from us and is this video

VPN

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.080
[ __ ] no it is not if you don't live

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.640
alone but get the chance to sometime I

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.319
would recommend it because you can

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.540
constantly eat junk food without shame

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.280
become entirely nocturnal and discover

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.180
the true meaning of independent living

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.459
oh yeah where's your toilet regime now

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.620
mum but living alone is a pretty recent

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.060
phenomenon just sleeping alone is a

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.160
pretty recent phenomenon even for the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.320
historically Rich privacy is an

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.120
invention we made that [ __ ] up but how

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.740
do we get here well for the first few

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.540
hundred thousand years of our time on

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.860
this watery spaceship it is unlikely

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.780
there were many loners for

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.400
hunter-gatherers going it alone probably

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.080
meant death because strength in numbers

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.540
was about the only trick that caps Us

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.340
Alive we were social by necessity and we

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.139
didn't do walls yet so other than the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.400
confines of your own mind how could you

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.979
have privacy in that social

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.320
configuration what was the most mostest

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.080
game-changing human invention fire the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.580
transistor all pretty rad yes but the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.860
wall is going to be up there in the top

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.139
five at least we've been doing walls for

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.880
about 23 000 years now the oldest one

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.100
we've found being in Greece of course

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.020
it's grease it's always Greece and not

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.520
only do walls signify property and

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.960
property is a pretty weird idea if

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.460
you've never heard of it before first

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.160
person to get the land gets the land

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.620
forever why but it also means that

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.660
security means castles means established

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.060
power structures and it's only so long

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.740
before Walls Start to mean privacy and

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.780
that was more or less codified for the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.460
first time we know of by the Greeks

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.080
because it's always the Greeks isn't it

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.240
and the distinction between the polis

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.520
and the Oikos the police being public

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.620
life politics she eat it outside really

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.020
and the Oikos your house your family

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.820
life [ __ ] you did inside really but even

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.380
then in most Greek tragedies the only

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.199
thing worse than getting executed was

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.120
being alone being exiled still our

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.120
ancestors understood privacy of the mind

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.100
just fine as in Secrets the Chinese

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.720
managed to keep the particulars of silk

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.940
production a secret for over a thousand

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.100
years by making you dead if you blab to

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.020
anyone then there was Greek Fire because

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.180
it's always the [ __ ] Greeks isn't it

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.280
a flammable slime used by the byzantines

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.380
during battle yeah that's right a 7th

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.240
century flamethrower and the secret of

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.440
its composition was so well kept we

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.720
still don't really know what the hell it

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.880
was today also the legend goes that when

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.800
Genghis Khan dies his funeral escort

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.720
kept his burial site a secret by

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.880
murdering anyone they passed on the way

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.100
there bit heavy-handed but points for

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.639
execution

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.639
literally literally

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.419
I long to die for the next ages us

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.800
Europeans at least did pretty much

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.020
everything under the Gaze of someone

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.419
else while at home eating weeping and

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.340
sleeping it's how we built our houses it

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.080
wasn't until the 17th century that some

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.960
genius thought to invent an entire room

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.300
for the bed the bedroom if you will but

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.400
beds themselves were crazy expensive

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.680
most homes could only afford a single

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.120
bed shared by family and guests which

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.039
meant not only did you get to witness

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.720
your nearest and dearest sleeping but

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.580
all the other activities that might

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.139
occur in a bedroom and while there

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.060
wasn't really a concept of medieval

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.160
privacy either there were ways to obtain

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.020
a little alone time like pissing off the

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.180
church and getting excommunicated big

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.280
fun or cutting off heads for a living

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.780
working as an executioner was so

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.000
shameful you wouldn't be invited into

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.979
others homes couldn't enter churches and

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.539
had to live on the fringes of town if

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.180
privacy is the right to be let alone

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:10.919
then along with monks executioners were

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.240
arguably kind of the pioneers of

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:15.240
something beginning to sound like modern

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.819
privacy but it would take a while yet in

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.680
the early 1900s Abigail Roberson one day

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.479
noticed a photo of herself on a poster

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.460
advertising flower she didn't remember

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.780
endorsing any flower so she sued the

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.639
company in question for using her

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.039
likeness without her permission she won

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.539
the case however the defendants appealed

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.220
claiming they hadn't taken anything of

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.139
worth from her and and they won the

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.240
appeal the chief judge writing actually

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:40.020
she should be touched as the ad was

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.639
quote a compliment to her beauty aha but

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.680
a pleasant surprise the public was

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.599
pissed at the ruling maximum pissed

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.639
resulting not too long after in the

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:49.139
first instance of legislation forbidding

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:50.639
using ones likeness without their

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:52.800
permission the beginning of modern

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:54.180
privacy really ironically the chief

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.440
judge we just mentioned who ruled

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.000
against her and said she should be

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.860
stoked because she was pretty and shut

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.419
up would run for president in a few

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.400
years and after getting snapped

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:03.900
constantly by photographers waxed at

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.000
Great length about how it was an

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.800
invasion of his privacy Abigail Roberson

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.840
reminded him in a letter in the New York

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.819
Times but you said there is no right to

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.520
privacy not so fun when it's being done

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:16.919
to you a what a [ __ ] and in just a few

decades Jesus Christo Things Are about

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:21.479
to get weirder because by now it's the

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:23.280
1960s computers are rather massive

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:25.319
trousers are rather silly and the cold

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.180
war is heating up the US Department of

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:29.400
Defense is interested in distributing

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.919
information across computers in case one

Link in the chain let's say breaks down

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:36.719
a bit enter are pronounce the first

packet switch Network and grandfather of

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:41.039
the modern internet and the first

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:43.140
message ever sent over arpanet from UCLA

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:45.540
to Stanford Research Institute was

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.120
supposed to be login however the system

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.740
fell over after two letters meaning the

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.980
internet's first message to the world

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:55.440
was low as in lo and behold I have

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.839
arrived you fox first words don't get

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.060
better than that by 1971 the first email

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:02.160
has been sent by 1973 the first

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.860
transatlantic connection is made then by

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.800
1978 Robert Khan and Vince Cerf have

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:10.320
designed TCP IP or transmission control

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.240
protocol Internet Protocol and if the

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.880
internet talks in the language this is

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.440
it by the 90s Tim berners-lee has kindly

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.360
invented the World Wide Web the retreat

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.279
evil of information architecture the

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.620
modern net is built on top of making

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:24.360
possible hypertext hyperlinks and the

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.980
first website you can still visit it

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.440
today and naturally comes the first

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.180
webcam it monitors a coffee machine at

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.760
Cambridge University for some reason

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:36.180
1980 3 the first graphical web browser

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:39.120
Mosaic and then the Moolah oh the Moolah

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.700
1994 and amazon.com makes his first

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.920
sales one of them notably to Bulgaria

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.019
for some books paid for in cash which is

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.760
sent over hidden inside a floppy disk so

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:50.940
the Customs inspectors won't steal it

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.640
clever as ever Bobby Bulgaria then enter

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.800
me and perhaps you 90s internet was

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.839
pretty weird a patchwork amalgamation of

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.580
misfiring search engines God or full

00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:01.320
site design and if someone had the

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.240
audacity to phone your house all they

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.579
got was The Sound of the modem it was

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.320
[ __ ] great but stranger While most

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:08.820
technologists have been expecting a

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.680
robotics Revolution for the end of the

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.360
century what we got instead was a

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.399
Communications Revolution clearly

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.440
preferable since yeah the internet can't

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:18.420
fetch your tea but more importantly you

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.640
can't watch pornography on a robot and

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.920
really this is just one idiot's biased

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.839
Nostalgia for a simpler time but not a

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.180
few decades ago the Hope For What the

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:29.459
internet could do was Limitless most

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.500
societal issues surely stemmed from a

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:33.480
lack of information and with all human

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.279
knowledge at our fingertips we would all

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.560
eventually come to the same objective

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:40.260
conclusions emerge from division and

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.019
ignorance and draw together in peace as

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.260
a unified digital family

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:47.940
and that went so-so oh yeah Utopia must

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.980
be just over the hill now mate I can

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.500
almost see it oh no that's just my dad's

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.360
only fans account hey Dad what A Brave

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.120
New World we've built somehow Brave New

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.980
World in 1984 at the exact same time we

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.660
were promised the end of History we were

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.220
promised ultimate truth we're supposed

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.339
to be solving world hunger and building

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.440
Interstellar Starships what is chungus I

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:09.300
do not understand what have we done to

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.579
ourselves we've broken epistemology

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.459
itself sacrificed truth in favor of

00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:18.740
mediated hyper reality and for what for

00:11:14.459 --> 00:11:18.740
what what the [ __ ] is chungus

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.160
sorry we were supposed to be talking

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.079
about privacy weren't we well we're kind

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.000
of boned right now and to talk about

00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:29.040
that we'll need a patronizingly simple

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.540
history of privacy which we've sort of

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.040
just done and some kind of beat

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.040
preferably a fat one

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.480
yep that'll do hey this is the

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:41.399
panopticon it's a prison design a guard

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.440
Tower sits at the center so the guard

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:46.019
can see all the inmates in a helpful 360

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.760
Panorama The Twist is that the prisoners

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:49.620
can't see into the tower and so never

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.000
know when they're being watched so they

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.920
may as well assume they're always being

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.899
watched the constant implication of

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.360
surveillance and what relevance could

00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:58.500
this have as a modern metaphor we

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.060
already know that governments are

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.860
snooping on our digital lives with

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.079
impunity but it's not just States

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.519
playing that game we're now knee-deep in

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:07.440
a technological Moment The Thinker

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:09.480
shashana zubov calls surveillance

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.820
capitalism or rather turning the

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.980
internet into a data Mill for no fun and

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.779
lots of profit and it has the potential

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.180
not just to corrupt the future of the

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:20.880
internet but remove any possibility of

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.519
digital privacy ever again in the early

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.139
2000s the.com Bubble Burst this was a

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:26.579
problem for Silicon Valley because no

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:28.200
one quite knew how to monetize the

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:30.420
internet yet and that 17th personal

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.060
yacht ain't just gonna buy itself Google

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.139
was clever they noticed the courtesy of

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.180
all the searches they were providing

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:38.820
they were that on a massive Buffet of

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.260
data from and about their users lots of

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.360
that data could be used to optimize

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.459
Google itself but a huge amount was left

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.920
over and incidental which we may as well

00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:49.139
call behavioral Surplus this was simple

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.000
stuffer firsts like noticing if a user

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:52.560
makes a lot of typos maybe that means

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.420
they're in a hurry or if they're

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.279
particularly diligent about apostrophes

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.620
maybe they're all bookish or whatever

00:12:56.279 --> 00:13:00.300
but in a stroke of Walter White levels

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.920
of cunning Google realized they could

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.720
use this leftover information to

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.700
generate predictive patterns about a

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.220
user's moods and desires and create

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.560
absurdly well-targeted advertising and

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.420
the great googly moogly it worked it

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.579
made them Rich beyond all imagining and

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.920
the best part is it's free users gave

00:13:14.579 --> 00:13:18.959
them their secrets for free in searches

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.480
now at this point no one is surprised

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:24.060
that if in a moment of 3 30 am whiskey

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.120
induced curiosity one searches willy

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.860
bigger how you will be bombarded for the

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.019
next 15 years with adverts for

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.300
questionable tonics and small weights on

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:35.459
Long strings kind of weird kinda

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.860
annoying but it's so much more Sinister

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:40.199
than that because as Google branched out

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.300
intermedia and email and navigation the

00:13:40.199 --> 00:13:45.180
data points for Behavioral Surplus for

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:47.279
its user Secrets grew and grew the inner

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.380
lives of Google's users became its

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:51.420
primary resource a fully automated data

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.399
Mill extracting highly specific details

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.800
of a user's psychology and turning that

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:57.180
into big bucks via advertising and of

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.399
course the more data you collect about

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.079
users as in the more behavioral Surplus

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:02.940
you extract the more behavioral

00:14:01.079 --> 00:14:04.920
correlations you can find and the more

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.480
efficient the game gets if I know that

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.579
you're trying to sell a wedding ring and

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.019
hire a divorce lawyer then I also know

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:12.360
you're probably at that point in your

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:14.399
life when it's a 95 vodka made from deck

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.740
chairs could sound appealing just been

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:18.779
for a run unrelatedly check out these

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.940
Amazing shoes contemplating turning your

00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:23.339
life around would some deck chair vodka

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.500
help and other companies soon got in on

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:27.000
behavioral Surplus 2 because if you

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.860
throw Health trackers and digital

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.720
thermostats and smart cars into the mix

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.880
all of them collecting buckets of

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.380
personal data it's possible to build an

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.600
even more accurate model of your desire

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.760
players or just sell that information to

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.320
third parties one's commute route and

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.420
heart rate and sleep habits all

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.220
helpfully recorded and transmitted by

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.839
the one object that will probably stay

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.060
no more than a foot away from our bodies

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:50.040
for the rest of our lives data one

doesn't impact us on a day-to-day level

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:25.980
yes

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.440

our digital likenesses our data our

00:16:43.079 --> 00:16:47.100
is well if you have nothing to hide you

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.839
have nothing to fear okay sounds great

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.519
but upon uttering that I hope you'll

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:52.079
allow your bathroom door to be removed

hide nothing to fear right privacy isn't

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:03.300
about having somewhere to do drug deals

00:17:01.079 --> 00:17:05.400
it's a basic tenet of modern human

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.559
living it is the right to be let alone

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.480
and we've only just codified it and we

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:11.459
may already be about to lose it if

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.559
companies can infer that we're bereaved

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:14.880
or pregnant or introverted or just going

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:16.620
through one of the many thousands of

Life crises humans enjoy during their

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.980
time as sentient meet well

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:21.600
simultaneously we know basically nothing

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.640
about how these companies are collecting

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.559
and using our data that that is an

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.600
egregious asymmetry a full wave

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:29.520
rectified data extraction panopticon

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.500
with the sole purpose of commodifying

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.840
our psychology of commodifying our

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.360
secrets now one obvious solution to this

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.100
is the restating of one's data as one's

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.900
personal property the problem with that

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.120
is that personal property can be sold

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.799
can become a commodity and your privacy

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.600
and your data are no more a commodity

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:48.000
than your right to free association or

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.679
Oxygen Plus behavioral Surplus isn't

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
just about an individual's data it's

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:52.799
about the data of groups and

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.600
demographics and things that can't be

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:56.640
personally owned but are terribly useful

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.380
as data points but whatever the solution

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.179
if we want to steer history away from

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.980
this waterfall it's going to take lots

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:03.480
of getting pissed off and if we don't do

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.039
something about this constantly

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.600
harvesting more and more behavioral

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:08.940
Surplus to keep the great data Mill

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.559
going will just be what the internet is

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.360
because that's how the next Generations

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:14.160
will grow up with it because the model

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.320
is already a massive part of the digital

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.840
economy later it will be the predominant

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.520
model and later will be too late we get

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.200
to decide now whether this was just a

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.600
historical blip like the rubber Barons

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.780
of the Gilded age or the shape of things

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.380
to come effectively killing privacy

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.380
forever

the Big Brother of surveillance has a

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:36.660
little brother called a surveillance

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:38.940
rather than being surveilled from the

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.980
top down systems watch from the bottom

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.679
up dashboard cameras for example

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:46.260
rebalancing the symmetry of Secrets by

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:48.120
watching the watches and maybe the best

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.280
fictional extreme of this ever written

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.200
is a Sci-Fi novel called the lights of

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.700
other days and I'm going to spoil a few

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.679
now since clearly you have nowhere

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.140
better to be and secondly because [ __ ]

00:18:55.679 --> 00:19:00.419
you sometime in the nearest Future a

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.340
company cracks wormholes only the

00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:05.039
wormholes are too small to send anything

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:07.320
through too small to see even but you

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:09.480
can peek inside so you can open a

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.220
wormhole anywhere on the planet and spy

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.840
on anyone on the planet without them

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.059
knowing and of course one of the main

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.980
uses immediately becomes surveilling

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:18.539
those more powerful watching the back

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.640
rooms of governments and corporations

00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:23.400
which makes corruption very difficult

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.500
then things get rather strange when some

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.539
genius realizes if you put a time delay

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.059
on the thing you can see back into the

00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:32.460
past anytime anywhere you can't

00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:34.320
influence the past because the plot says

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.960
so but you can watch anything that ever

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.480
happened things do not go well Mass

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.860
outcry suicides every terrible thing

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.020
you've ever said is now immediately

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.299
available in 4k people watch their own

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.100
conceptions it gets weird but the next

00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:48.600
Generations to grow up are a bit more

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.940
relaxed about it all because the

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.679
Wormhole technology is everywhere they

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.720
dress functionally and for fashion

00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:57.120
rather than modesty because why cover

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.460
anything everyone has seen already they

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.440
have no concept of personal privacy but

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.480
as a consolation they also have no

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.820
concept of being surveilled by powerful

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.500
eyes unseen because the Watchers can

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.080
always be watched they've replaced the

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.179
panopticon with many panopticons 8

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.860
billion of them everyone is a watcher

00:20:12.179 --> 00:20:15.840
the story ends with finding out human

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.700
life was seeded by sentient insectoids

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.799
bit left field but ultimately the

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.080
wormholes become a very strange way of

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:24.480
rebalancing the asymmetry of Secrets by

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.100
abolishing all secrets and it isn't that

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.380
much of a stretch to imagine we might

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:31.020
face a similar conundrum sometime soon

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.940
the smallest camera ever made weighs a

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.280
gram and is about the size of a grain of

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.679
sand the resolution is in Grace 200 by

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.360
200 pixels but that's enough to do some

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:41.400
decent spying and it's not like the

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.260
resolution won't get better and it's not

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.120
like this won't soon extend to drones

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.159
perhaps the size of gnats with full

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.900
audio and video capture and it's not

00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:50.640
like they won't be Mass manufactured and

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.500
purchasable combine that with ever

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.720
increasing data storage combine that

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.280
with whatever brain machine interfaces

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.260
the next Generations will be messing

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.640
around with it's not hard to imagine we

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.919
might build a different kind of

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.360
panopticon one in which it's taken for

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:05.460
granted that you're probably being

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.380
watched that everything you've ever said

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.900
and done has been recorded and can be

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.820
accessed by anyone at any time and that

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.039
you can do the same at any time to

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.140
everyone you know a participatory an

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:18.419
Opticon now that sounds horrible

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.640
obviously like one long episode of bling

00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:22.740
Empire there will be no escape from

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.720
every stupid slip of the tongue 20 years

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.760
ago potentially from every invasive

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.200
thought but the benefit of course is

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.480
that unless the powerful had

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.280
invisibility cloaks or lived in faradays

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.620
ages they would have to play the game

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.780
too no one would be exempt from the

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:39.000
participatory panopticon it's a very

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.919
strange kind of fair but a lot more fair

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.140
than the current Mill of asymmetrical

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:45.179
secrets we live in at the moment I don't

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.919
know man the road to hell is paved with

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:49.559
good inventions when it comes to

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:51.900
panopticons none is better than one but

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:53.580
one is a lot worse than 8 billion if

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.100
technology is going to semi-break

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.860
privacy anyway maybe better that it'd be

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.539
on our own terms 500 years ago there was

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.039
no way Gutenberg could have known just

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:04.500
how game-changing his printing press

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:05.880
would be likewise there's no way we can

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.380
even guess what the internet's

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.140
great-great-grandchild will look like

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:12.179
500 years from now digital telepathy

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:15.299
disembodied human consciousness itself

00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:17.100
who knows but as all inventions do it

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:19.260
will bear the Hallmarks of whatever bad

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.240
habits its parents taught it when it was

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.700
little and we are teaching it some very

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.220
very bad habits and whatever it grows up

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.900
into it will be us who shapes that who

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.419
hopefully taught it that knowledge is

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:33.360
power but spying from Ivory Towers is

00:22:30.419 --> 00:22:35.159
rude which means it'll also be us who

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.380
determine the digital landscape our

00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:39.299
descendants grow up in and whether or

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:43.260
not that landscape is an equitable

00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:45.539
Meadow or a digitized Victorian Mill

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.820
whether Enchanted water flows

00:22:45.539 --> 00:22:50.940
unobstructed through the city listening

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:53.400
to us yes but impartially and replying

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.140
when asked to convey not only visions of

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.419
other possible cities and other possible

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.640
worlds but showing ourselves to

00:22:57.419 --> 00:23:00.960
ourselves whether that water runs

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.960
unobstructed through the streets

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.400
bringing edification and information

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.380
reporting of the distant hopeful and

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.600
fabulous strange whether that water

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.640
flows down to the Estuary and sustains

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.100
those towering assiduous trees of

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.840
knowledge we grow over our heads one

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.640
great Forest Network across the

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.039
revolution World talking in all

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.200
languages of all things for all time

00:23:20.039 --> 00:23:24.179
such that if Interstellar visitors

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.860
arrived a hundred years from now and

00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:27.720
looked down upon the world and the

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.580
enchanted water and the forest we have

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.799
built that the forest might be so wise

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.900
and mighty they'd mistake the forest for

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:35.940
the true Steward of the planet and in

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.980
many ways considering how difficult it

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.200
was to build and how much it gave us in

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.460
return for building it it very well

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.159
might be

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:46.559
or whether instead the water is damned

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:48.659
and the Estuary drained and wet fog is

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:51.179
All That Remains of it fog that Waits

00:23:48.659 --> 00:23:52.919
with Insidious ubiquity in every spot of

00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:54.659
the house and mind one might once have

00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:56.820
attempted to go and be alone in whether

00:23:54.659 --> 00:23:58.740
that fog is Engineers to no longer speak

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.500
to us of distant places or possible

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.360
Futures but only forever listens with a

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.640
single omnipresent ear to our most

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.620
private hopes and phobias whether the

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.480
operation becomes so efficient that of a

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.340
dim evening one can step outside into

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.740
the gray Twilight and look out to the

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.260
roads which one knows beneath stream all

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.880
of one's secrets to look skyward a no

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.620
one's secrets are being dispatched to

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.659
ingenious silver Birds overhead

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.580
whereupon their blown-like pollen across

00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:25.559
the entire globe and finally received

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.480
and Consolidated into perfectly ordered

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:30.299
data sets in far-flong and enormous

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:32.460
Halls where there resides a great Kraken

00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:34.860
a kraken who does not sleep who does not

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.900
tire and is never full a kraken who

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.400
listens of all the dreams and secrets of

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.200
all those who live in the fog and

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.419
lovingly utilizes those dreams and

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.000
secrets for the production ever more

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:46.919
opulent Trinkets and wears a kraken so

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.659
saturated in secrets that it considers

00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:50.880
the currents of the human heart and mind

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:53.400
no less manipulable than the diverting

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.740
of a stream or tilling of a field a

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.080
kraken that knows full well if Enchanted

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.960
water only listens then that isn't an

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:03.960
enchantment that's a curse that is a

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.880
[ __ ] hex oh yeah let's hex the water

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.799
that's a great idea that total

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.659
confiscation of privacy via corporate

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:11.580
surveillance the usurping of human

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:13.620
psychology via Opera and conditioning

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.059
the great end of History purchased and

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.620
delivered at the soonest convenience

00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:18.360
whatever you want whatever you didn't

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.159
even know you wanted the only price

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.260
being standing epistemically naked

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:24.539
before digital Gods Who Remain forever

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.980
shrouded and the most diabolical part of

00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:27.659
the door that we built the cage for

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.520
ourselves not even from some orwellian

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:31.559
will to control not even from some

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.320
stupid fear of the other or Terror in

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:37.570
face of our own Natures but simply to

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.690
make a buck to make a buck

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.690
[Music]

00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:46.500
normally I would love to play you out

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.840
with some Carl Sagan ripoff rant about

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:51.179
how humans are great and wow Space is

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.880
really big Etc but we could screw

00:25:51.179 --> 00:25:56.159
ourselves over so so royally with this

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.860
stuff to the point that the recovery of

00:25:56.159 --> 00:26:00.659
human dignity becomes impossible that it

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.279
might be best not to end this one with

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:05.760
any false optimism

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:08.360
so hope you're doing Tip Top

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.360
boy
