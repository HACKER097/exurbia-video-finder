00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.360
hi i wrote a new book and i hope you

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.080
hate it

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.879
and it's out now and it's new and i hope

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.280
you hate it

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.000
it's called geometry for ocelots this is

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.679
an ocelot

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.280
if you weren't aware they're nice aren't

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.200
they so here's the deal

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.880
very quickly it's set in a balkan

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.960
universe in the deep deep future

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.480
chronicling a war between two siblings

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.320
as they build their own empires

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.080
the sister a living deity and the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.320
brother are fairly deranged scientists

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.080
and the ideological conflict that ensues

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.240
i really don't know how to do trailers

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.880
for books what do you even show

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.440
look words it's got words [Â __Â ] loads

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.480
of them a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.559
it's a 2 000 year family saga in essence

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.640
there's animal gods and space battles

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.879
and zero gravity drinking competitions

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.320
i've always loved magical realism and

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.680
i've been waiting for someone to do

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.840
magical scientism

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.960
i guess and i got bored of waiting so

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.039
this is my attempt

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.000
it's basically a love letter to my three

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.079
favorite things

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.160

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.119
last year or so on youtube

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.880
it's just i got obsessed with this story

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.159
and i wanted to get it right and it took

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.600
a bit of thinking and

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.759
i've been waiting to share it with you

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.759
for almost three years now so i'm very

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.600
very excited to finally be doing so

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.880
thank you to patreon folks you should

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.560

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.119
to wait for this one just thank you very

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.280
very much i really hope the wait was

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.159
worth it this is the longest and i'd

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.000
mutually say

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.320
weirdest thing i've ever done and about

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.799

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.840
then sorry

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.360
i guess but that's what you get for

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.640
buying self-promoted books on youtube

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.079
