00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.260
At the foot of the last mountain, sat the last village.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.780
And in the last village lived Tao.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.100
It was Tao's birthday.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.880
While he was working the corn, his friend Samuel shouted over him to come quick.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.700
Tao ran to the edge of the village where the "death barrier" was,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.500
and beyond the death barrier was his father, lying on the ground.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.680
Tao ran to his father.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.280
His father wasn't breathing.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.240
Tao dragged the old man back over the death barrier and the village doctor checked his father over.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.600
The doctor said, "I'm sorry, he is dead."

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.800
"The snake did this."

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.860
The next day the village folk came to Tao's house and said "Isn't it a shame...", "Sorry for your loss", and so on, and Tao thanked them.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.100
And then he was alone... again.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.600
He hoped he'd get good at being alone soon.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.560
That night he watched the great mountain glowing with the light and madness of the New Gods.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.440
Who knew what they were doing up there...

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.040
When Tao slept, he dreamt of the snake that had killed his father; its fangs curved like scimitars, its eyes full of rage and malice and pride,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.780
Ruled the evil over that it exacted on the village folk for hundreds of years, bringing disease, and misery.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.180
And now, it had brought death to his father.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.360
Enough.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.760
Tao got up just before dawn, he packed some water and food into a satchel,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.700
then went to the pyre where his father had been cremated and took his father's ashes,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.360
and put them into a jam jar.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480
Then he walked out to the boundary of the village, to the death barrier.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.120
"Stop!" someone yells.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.820
It was the village doctor.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.020
"You step over the barrier, you can die. Leave the snake be, you can't fight him."

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.220
Tao closed his eyes and stepped over the death barrier, and walked out into the wilderness.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.220
Tao trudged about the forest all day looking for the snake, but found nothing.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.360
He saw his father's face in the trees.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.100
Where had his father gone? This man who'd given him his time, his love and taught Tao how the world worked.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.720
He brought Tao breakfast in the mornings and blankets in the evenings. He brought him up!

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.500
But his father had gone off into the dark, alone now.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.040
And Tao knew he couldn't bring his father breakfast, or bring him blankets, or bring him back.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.100
The snake, the bastard. He would kill him.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.520
Tao's out of water and thirsty. He spied the great mountain above the trees and walked towards it.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.500
At the foot of the mountain was a river and he drank from the river for a long time.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.360
When he looked up again, there was an old woman, sat a few feet away on the ground.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.900
The old woman took a swig from a hip flask; Tao turned to leave.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.480
"Hey!", the old woman yowled. Tao ignored her.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.880
She said, "You look like someone with unfinished snake-related business."

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.280
Tao stopped. "What do you know about the snake?"

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.340
"Green one, about yay high?", she said.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.300
"Maybe."

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.380
She pointed up the mountain. "I saw him! Went that way, he did."

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.380
"Did he know", Tao said.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.940
"Oh yes! And a mighty sneaky sneaky wiggle he had about him also."

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.860
"Yeah."

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.400
Tao began to walk away.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.920
"That's where the snake lives, you know", the old woman said, "on the mountain."

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.800
"That's where he thinks up his evil plans, and he was mumbling something about how he'd just killed an old man, too."

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.780
"Well, that was beyond coincidence", Tao thought. "Maybe she knew something."

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.780
Tao started off for the mountain instead.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.540
"Hey!", the old woman yowled, but Tao ignored her.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.360
He walked for some minutes, before he spied another figure ahead, sat on the ground.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.360
It was the old woman, again.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.780
"How did you get here?", Tao said. She took a draw on her hip flask.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.080
"You need a guide", she said, "a chaperone. He's awful tricky to beat, old Snakels."

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.020
Tao said, "Not to be rude, but you are drunk, and old, and a bit useless, really."

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.420
"You are being rude", she said.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.600
Tao walked on, but she followed behind.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.300
"I know things", she said. "I know things about the snake and the New Gods, too."

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.360
"Rubbish", Tao said. "Is it?", the old woman said.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.000
"Take me up the mountain and I'll teach you how to kill the snake."

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.080
"I'll kill him myself with my bare hands", Tao said.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.920
"No", the old woman said. "No, you won't."

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.100
They looked about under rocks then, and holes, but the snake wasn't there.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.820
"He must have gone further up". And so they climbed.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.340
They slept rough and in the morning they had breakfast.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.440
For Tao it was bread, for the old woman it was her hip flask.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.240
They continue walking up the mountain. By midday, they are high enough to look down on the landscape properly.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.000
And there was Tao's village, unremarkable. Just a few buildings, wisps of smoke in the valley.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.300
"Are there other villages in the world?", Tao asked.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.560
"No". "Were there?"

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.260
"Yes". "When?"

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.440
"A long time ago. There used to be very big villages, called cities, once. Lots of people back then."

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.640
"What happened?"

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.900
"Ambition", the old woman said.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.700
She drank from her hip flask.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.620
"Say, boy, when you kill the snake, and he's gone, you think you'll be happy forever then?"

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.840
"Yes", Tao said without pausing.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.920
"Hmm", the old woman said. "Hmm."

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.360
They looked about under rocks then, and holes, but the snake wasn't there.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.260
"He must have gone further up". And so they climbed.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.660
They slept rough again, and woke to a gray and sickly dawn.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.620
They set off in silence and soon they came into a fog that collected about their knees.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.760
The air smelt metallic. The daylight looked wrong.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.960
"What's happening?", Tao said.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.820
The old woman said nothing, only swigged on her hip flask.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.280
Tao saw something in the dirt, silver and complicated. "What's that?", he said.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.280
"Old science", the hag said.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.200
"What's science?". The old woman said, "Sort of like magic, but it works."

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.280
There were more machines now, silver, glass, great towers of geometry and industry.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.200
"Who built these things?", Tao said.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.720
"Well, the New Gods, of course."

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.140
"Why have they abandoned them?"

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.480
"Because all children get bored of their toys eventually", she said.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.720
And about them appeared lines and symbols, esoteric glyphs in the air, and lights flashed in the distance,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.060
and a great wind picked up and the metallic reek grew thicker.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.580
The rocks were not rocks now, but hexagonal metal slabs, and the trees were twisting candles of crystal.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.500
And ahead glowed a pedestal, and upon the pedestal was a set of spectacles.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.540
The old woman picked them up. "Here boy", she said.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.720
"These are the glasses you'll know the snake with."

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.280
"Glasses?", Tao said. "My vision's fine."

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.120
"No, it's not". She put them on his face.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.880
Suddenly, Tao spalled from his body and senses and saw the world with her mask on.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.660
A tangle of fields and dimension, the height of time, the width of space.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.820
And he knew then that matter was both a point and a wave and a joke.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.940
And he saw the logic at the bottom of everything, the madness at the top,

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.120
and the shape of becoming, and the dance of decline.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.840
And finally then he saw himself, in true perspective.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.040
A speck on a blob on a smudge on a blemish on a fleck,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.420
in a grain of galactic sand amid a billion other beaches,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.220
and those beaches themselves only made up more grains of sand, and more grains of sand,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.920
and more grains of sand, and more grains of sand, and more grains of sand.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.760
The old woman removed the glasses.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.200
"What was that?", Tao whispered.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.460
"Oh, 31st century science. Bit before your time."

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.180
She gave him the glasses. "Keep these safe, eh?"

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.080
"Who are you?", Tao said.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.440
"Oh", she replied. "Who's anyone?"

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.440
They looked about under rocks then, and holes, but the snake wasn't there.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.600
"He must have gone further up". And so they climbed.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.440
The next morning they wake after dawn and have a fine view of Tao's village below.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.620
Tao said, "Why is the world dead?"

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.260
The old woman said, "Everyone got clever. Now they're gone."

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.720
"Where are they gone?", Tao said and pointed to the sky. "There?"

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.340
She shirked. "Come on, time's getting on."

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.660
They continued up the mountain, the peak high above, the village low below.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.540
Tao thought again of his father. He imagined the days ahead as empty and overcast.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.200
Noone to talk to, truly. No more games, no more laughing.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.000
When he found the snake, he would rip it apart.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.620
He spied a stream, then, and the water was red, and he realized it was blood.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.980
The stream of blood grew thicker as they climbed. No, it was a river of blood.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.960
And on the ground were notes, and coins, and precious jewels, and staffs, and sceptres.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.720
The ground was scorched, and from the ground rose smoldering vapors,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.960
and the air stank of death and glory, and dominion.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.820
And ahead, Tao spied a sword.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:57.500
It was sticking out of the soil. Its hilt glinting red and purple and gold. And the blade an opulent silver.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.640
They sidled closer. "Take it from the ground then boy", the old woman said.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.380
"What is it?", Tao said. "That is the sword you'll kill the snake with."

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.400
And with a great effort, Tao wrenched the sword from the ground and brandished it.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.480
And great plumes of fire and lightning leapt from the tip and set the ground alight.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:19.040
Tao brandished it again, and out shot swarms of locusts and wasps and he bellowed a great stentorian laugh.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.400
And the laughter echoed out over the plain of the mountain.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.620
Everything was power. Everyone would listen to him now.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.100
The village elders, the oracles, the bullies and the brutes.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.100
Hell, even the snake, when the time came.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.100
He laughed again and the mountain was only fire and lightning then.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.080
His only power and malignancy and rage.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.320
"Thou shalt always kill", he thought.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.900
And he knew that noone could do a damn thing to stop him, ever again.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.440
And more than that, with a dastardly certainty he supposed that with this thing,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.740
he could end the world, if he wanted.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.880
The next morning Tao ate in silence, and the old woman drank in silence, and they got walking as usual.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.360
Tao said, "How long until we find the snake?"

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.340
The old woman drank, said nothing.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.480
"Isn't that thing empty already?", Tao said.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.860
She turned the flask upside down and pulled out a constant stream of booze that didn't end.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.980
"Are you one of the New Gods?", Tao said.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.980
"Do I look new?", the old woman said.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.980
"Well, what happened to the New Gods?"

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.300
"The snake", she said.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.200
"It killed them?" "Sure."

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.320
Tao stopped. "Well, how in the hell do you think I was gonna beat it, if it killed the New Gods?"

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.840
"The thought hadn't crossed my mind", the old woman mumbled.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.440
"Still, the glasses and sword will serve you well. We have a few more things to collect here."

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.880
"Like what?", Tao said.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.020
But already, he heard music; upbeat, calling to him.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.200
They came on the remains of a great party; empty bottles, discarded trinkets.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.080
"What happened here?", Tao said.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.080
"Abandon", the old woman said.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.740
In ruins of an old and ostentatious house, burnt partly to the ground, was a tankard that glowed.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.300
And inside the tankard was what looked, and smelled like mead.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.960
"Go on", the old woman said. "Drink a little."

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.360
"What is it?", Tao said.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.100
"This, is the indulgence you'll kill the snake with."

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.100
And with that, Tao drank.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.120
And when the cup came away, the old woman grabbed Tao's hand, and led him into a dance.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.520
The mountain began to spin about them, the colours blurring.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.100
"What's happening?!", Tao yelled.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.920
And the old woman yelled, "That's it! Dance, you bastard!"

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.140
And Tao and the old woman danced across the mountain, over the debauchery and under the moon.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.580
And suddenly, Tao was not thinking of his father; or the snake, or the village.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.480
"What if there's no point to anything?" the old woman sang. "Who cares?"

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.060
"Who cares?" Tao agreed.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.520
"Tragedies happen, people die. It's all a game, it's all a facade!

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.400
"There's no salvation, no meaning!"

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.280
He saw into the heart of things now and knew there was no "hard";

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.900
That everything was suffering, and even that didn't matter.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.700
A joke God was playing on the world, for nothing more than his own sick amusement.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.680
They moved to the cliff. Feet stepping in perfect time, the stars spinning about at a dizzying pace.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.720
And the mountain echoed with the music of reckless abandon, and nothing mattered now.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.160
"Fuck 'em", Tao thought. "Fuck 'em."

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.260
And they danced the nihilist waltz, long into the night, until the sun began to rise.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.480
Tao woke with a throbbing head, and a mouth that tasted like death.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.740
The old woman was already up, smoking a pipe.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.280
"All well?", she said. "Mm...", Tao mumbled.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.700
"Was the dancing really necessary?", he said

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.700
The woman nodded. "Certainly was!"

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.660
"Come on, we're very close now. The snake can't hide forever."

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.600
"I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell is going on!", Tau shouted suddenly.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.600
"Where are the New Gods, where is the snake, and who are you?!"

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.600
"Yeah, whatever. Come on, then."

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.720
She set off walking, but Tao didn't move.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.420
She paused, rolled her eyes.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.220
"Alright, alright," she muttered. "What's the year?"

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.660
"Hmm... 326," Tao said.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.620
"By your calendar, yes. By mine, it's the 98th century."

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.840
"Your ancestors did some wonderful things; became very powerful and wise, alright?"

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.280
"Those objects; the glasses, the sword, the tankard; these are the things they left behind. Relics."

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.280
"Relics of what?" "I'll show you."

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.360
"No!" Tao yelled, "No more games!"

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.800
The old woman snapped then,

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.540
"Look!" she said, "You're only doing all of this because you think you killed your father!"

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.460
"He asked you what you wanted for your birthday, and you said, 'a meteorite.' "

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.340
"So he went out beyond the death barrier to find you one. And that's how he ended up dead."

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.100
"So don't take all this out on me."

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.640
Tao was silent awhile, then said quietly, "How do you know that?"

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.440
"Because I'm really, really clever. And I'm trying to help you here, so would you give an old woman a break?"

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.200
Tao thought about this and collected his things. They walked on, in silence.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.080
The village was almost invisible below, and the mountain peak was very close.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.760
They turned a corner, and came upon a picture of a king. Then a queen, then more.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.500
The portraits, regal and proud; with faces that spoke of legacy, and divine right.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.080
They pushed on, and now the portraits were of scenes Tao didn't recognize;

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.220
Of battles and rulers, and machines, and great structures that kissed the skyline.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.840
Episodes from his species' history that he'd never heard of, let alone considered.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.640
Millions, dead and gone. Whole nation states turned to dust.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.180
The great human project, forgotten; as though a dream upon waking.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.540
Testament to a time when billions existed, on a fragile marble, among the ink dark of space.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:02.460
Holding out against the hostile cosmos, and yet worse threats that lurked, within themselves.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.420
And somehow, for a long time, against all odds and sense, they did hold out.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.360
Bettering themselves slowly, as a toddler attempts to climb a set of steps.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.120
Then, for some reason, devolving, again.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.340
The great sleep; the great forgetting.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.300
Sent to bed, with no supper.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.540
Then decline, then savagery, then dust.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.460
And ahead, Tao spied, was a pair of armoured boots.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.580
"There," the old woman said. "For as long as you wear those, you'll never die."

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.580
"You can live into your thousands, if you like.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.440
"This is the armour you'll defend yourself with, from the snake." They fitted perfectly.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.620
"And one more thing," the old woman said.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.980
She took from her shawl a necklace.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.120
And on the necklace was a locket, and in the locket was a picture

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.080
of Tao's father.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.500
She put the necklace over his head.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.100
"To remember," she said. "This is the story you'll kill the snake with."

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.520
He felt finally ready to do battle since he'd begun his adventure, up the mountain.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.340
He knew it would only be a short walk, now.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:07.220
The peak was just a few yards away. It was only a small plateau, and the wind was high here. And it was raining.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.060
And there, sat the snake.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.180
Its back turned to Tao, staring off into the dead wilderness below.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.040
"There you are," the old woman said. "Do as you will."

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.840
With the glasses of the New Gods on his face, he saw the snake in its essence:

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.360
Its black heart, its cunning mind, its contempt for the last remaining humans.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.600
Tao approached, silently. His heart and his temples, his eyes wide, his hand clutching the locket of his father.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.620
And he thought of his father then. He thought of the man dead; thought of the futility of death.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:41.900
And he closed his eyes, and screamed, and brought the sword down with such power that it struck a grating chord out into the rain.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.580
And rang all the way back to the mountain's base.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.980
He opened his eyes.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.660
The snake, was gone.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.660
Tao turned around to the old woman.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.660
"Where did he go? Did you see him?"

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.420
"No," said the old woman.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.660
"I didn't see him, because he doesn't exist."

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.660
The rain was getting heavier.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.660
Tao stood silently in his armour.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.700
The old woman said, "Did you really think there was some evil snake, on a mountain,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.600
bringing death and misery into the village?"

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.140
"Did you really think the world was so simple, that only one thing is responsible for all the bad days?

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.900
"God, what is it with you lot?!"

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.400
"You have everything, you know that? And you spit on it, like living in some enormous mansion."

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.680
"And one day, you find a chipped brick, so you burn the whole damn house down."

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.200
"You've got everything down there. I gave you everything."

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.280
"Endless food, endless life. And you're still miserable."

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.900
"Shit, do you know how difficult it is, playing deity?"

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.900
"I'd give anything, just to give up, knowing everything."

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:38.840
And on the skyline appeared shimmering, and translucent buildings. High-technology and science.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.600
"They got everything they wanted, your ancestors", the old woman said.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.000
"And they still weren't happy. The snake was still there; misery, chaos and death."

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.940
"They tried sending it away with perfect knowledge, they tried killing it with ultimate power,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.360
"They tried forgetting it with abandon, they tried living longer, they tried clinging to each other;

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.920
"The spectacles, sword, tankard, armour, and necklace."

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.520
"They looked about under rocks then, in holes, but the snake wasn't there. 'He must have gone further up.' "

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.340
"And so they climbed, and climbed, and climbed,

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.440
and found nothing. It was just them in the universe, and they were still miserable."

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.820
"So the New Gods are all gone now. All except me.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.700
"And your species is gone too, now. All except your village, the old mode of living.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.060
"I keep you lot around because it's a nice souvenir, to how we were once."

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.660
"I'm sorry your father is gone. I'm sorry you'll never see him again.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.200
"But there's a whole village down there, of people who love you.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.320
"And here you are, screaming at the wind on a fucking mountain."

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.140
"Bad things happen, and the reasons for them are complicated.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.220
"There is no snake, no witch, no evil genius.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.620
And there'll never come a time when everything lasts forever, nothing hurts ever again."

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.960
"But the strength is in taking a good look into the abyss, into the eyes of the snake,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.300
and then choosing to still, be a good human."

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.440
"Even in the face of great uncertainty, and malice, and that day when everything will be gone, forever.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.500
It's not gone yet. It won't be, for ages.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.060
Don't waste your time on snakes and windmills.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.340
'Say goodbye."

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.760
She took the jam jar out of Tao's satchel and gave it to him.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.740
She put her arm around his shoulder.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.700
Slowly, Tao opened the jar.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.420
And the wind took the ashes of his father and flung them out over the mountain.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.420
And in the last light of dusk, they were not unlike a million tiny meteorites.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.160
All done with being cosmic, and bound for the everyday ground.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:25.020
The old woman said, "Your species, mine once, too."

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.820
"We must be the only creatures allergic to happiness."

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.420
"We ruled the galaxy, a long time ago, and still quibbled over who got more ice cream for dessert.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.740
Still wanted to pretend we didn't come from the mud,

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.540
Still couldn't accept that meaning and solace aren't to be found in the heavens,

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.700
but in the trenches of everyday living.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.400
"We'll know everything, and then, we'll be okay.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.920
We'll kill everything, and then, we'll be okay.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.440
We'll forget everything, and then, we'll be okay.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.540
We'll live forever, and then, we'll be okay.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.540
We'll cling to everyone, and then, we'll be okay.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.740
And even then, we weren't okay.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.640
Because that's not how the game works."

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.140
"Go home, Tao. Don't try to be a hero, or a sage, or a warrior.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.800
"Just exist for a while and be decent. That's heroism enough.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.460
That's how it's always been done."

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.760
"Hey, you wanna keep the glasses, and sword, and tankard, and armour? You can rule the world, if you like.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.320
"No," Tao said.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.440
"Good choice."

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.180
Tao said, "Am I the first from the village, to come up after the snake?"

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.500
"Boy," the old woman said, "Everyone from the village came up. One by one."

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.240
"I gave them all the same treatment, they all went back down. Even your father."

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.980
"God, he asked a lot of stupid metaphysical questions, I can see where you get it.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.980
"You're the last one to come up here."

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.980
"So go home, be human.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.980
The universe doesn't give a shit about you.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.800
Your village, your family, me; we do.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.320
"Remember your dad. Love him always. God knows he loved you.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.580
And come up here any time you like, and we'll hang out, and remember him,

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.460
together."

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.480
Tao took off the glasses, and the armour, and the tankard, and laid the sword down on the ground.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.420
"Can I keep the necklace?", he said.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.200
"Of course," she said.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.920
"And the memories, they will always be yours too."

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.900
The curtain of ashes was gone now.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.900
The sky was clear and fine.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.980
He set off, back down the last mountain, bound for the last village.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.880
It would not be a difficult walk.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.660
And even if it were, he thought, he would not mind so much, now.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.580
It would give him time to remember.
