00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.850
let's imagine for a moment that someone

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.380
divides by zero at the Large Hadron

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.549
Collider and time travel actually

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.950
becomes a reality

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.360
well actually already is a reality see

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.099
the theory of special relativity showed

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.790
us the time can actually be moving at

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.320
different speeds

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.480
for two different people depending on

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.640
where they are in the universe the crazy

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.800
I know but this is science and this

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.970
is all thanks to gravity so one way to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.710
do this would be to build an enormous

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.480
leaf a spaceship and approach the speed

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.099
of light and you will find the closer

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.539
you get to the speed of light the faster

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
the universe ages outside of your

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.679
spaceship very simply this is why let's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.230
take this graph the y axis is time

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.850
passed and the axis distance covered now

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.200
to begin with with stationary but the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.270
faster you get the more distance you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.610
cover so you begin to ascend slower on

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.010
the y axis the faster you cover distance

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.809
the slower time passes for you the line

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.149
can't be split in two it can only cover

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.250
one more than the other believe it or

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.570
not we know this happens now GPR

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.890
satellites are actually programmed to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.329
allow for a slight discrepancy in the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.800
passage of time since they're effective

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.410
less by the gravity of the earth than we

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.500
are and so relatively experienced time

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.879
at the faster rate crazy so one

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.439
time machine may not be a time machine

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.780
at all but a spaceship traveling very

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.950
very fast this could also be done on

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.689
earth if we have the technology to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.970
create gravitational distortions but

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.290
that's some equally crazy this is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.700
all well and good but if you traveled a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.869
few thousand years into your own future

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.220
and didn't like what you saw you

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.689
wouldn't actually be able to get back

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.700
well one way of doing this might be a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.710
wormhole wormholes were originally

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.210
conceived by Einstein and Rosen and a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.409
paper famously entitled but hell are

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.119
balls to the walls awesome

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.590
conjecture supposedly because upon

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.880
realizing the two distant points in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.530
space could be folded together

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.299
Einstein proclaimed that is how the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.490
Bulls thought awesome it's like

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.960
this let's imagine the point a is in the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.759
Crab Nebula and this over here is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.170
refrance and then we want to travel

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.729
between the two without the several

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.350
thousand years of waiting so what we do

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.790
is using a huge amount of energy we make

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.229
a fold in space linking the two together

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.970
until we have a bridge between the two

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.040
points and travel through it's a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.540
shortcut in space however if you could

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.520
anchor one under the wormhole in the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.530
present and somehow put the other end in

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.640
a spaceship from earlier accelerates it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.500
to the speed of light and give it a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.060
while you could conceivably step through

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.369
into the future and return to your own

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.950
time whenever you wanted now the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.049
standard Hollywood idea is this you a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.160
disembodied British narrator decide the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.479
perhaps you should have gotten a job in

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.709
your 18 instead

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.700
years getting a liberal arts degree that

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.959
no one even seems to care about

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.549
anyway despite his merit and worth

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.349
compared to media study plans go back in

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.980
time and change history you step into a

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.150
time machine

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.620
travelled about five years into the past

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.970
and successfully managed to convince

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.069
your past self to go get a job instead

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.019
thus sending the timeline off in a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.390
different direction and great all's well

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.890
and the credits come out etc but there's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.390
a problem see you've just changed the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.980
course of history and while that may be

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.450
advantageous to your past self you know

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.030
originated from a timeline that no

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.860
longer exists one possibility is that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.450
you cease to exist now meaning you never

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.829
actually got to experience the rewards

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.150
of your efforts in the first place all

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.040
this might happen

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.510
instead of that initial divergence the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.700
previous timeline you came from still

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.870
exists the difference is that the moment

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.299
you travel back in time the universe

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.519
split itself in two and allowed few

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.900
actions in the first universe for all

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.410
intensive purposes you vanished without

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.940
a trace

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.370
and no longer exists but then the other

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.739
universe you came back and initiated a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.810
new set of events now two universes

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.310
exist running parallel side-by-side the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.660
reason Hollywood almost never follows

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.700
this line of reasoning is because it

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.680
would make a film another reason is

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.000
that is sort of logically impossible if

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.379
you had gone back in time and changed

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.519
whatever it was in their life presumably

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.660
you already would have done it meaning

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.970
you didn't need to do in the first place

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.630
right cook it well here's another wait

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.239
situation

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.620
I call these a causal loops imagine one

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.849
day someone anonymously leaves the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.470
winning lottery numbers on your doorstep

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.000
and instead of checking so take it on

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.160
the night of the draw you go to a party

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.200
instead next week you realize your error

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.150
and God and other stupid it's too late

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.590
but oh wait I've got this time machine

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.819
kicking around in the spare bedroom I'll

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.130
just take the ticket back a few weeks

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.720
and give it to myself so you travel back

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.940
a few weeks only to find that no one is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.650
in the house so instead being sure that

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.060
your past self won't miss the hid you

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.290
leave the lottery ticket on the doorstep

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.180
so that when your past self comes home

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.530
he finds it there picks it up and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.060
promptly forgets about for a week until

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.859
he realizes it is forgotten how things

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.030
are but I've got that spare time machine

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.500
kicking around in this bad bedroom and

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.669
the loop goes on forever

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.470
and where did the lottery ticket come

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.790
from originally man and I like this idea

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.470
because the possibilities are almost

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.060
limitless what if in a few hundred years

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.650
some intrepid scientist creates a

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.239
supernova powered time machine and just

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.120
wish it's and giggles decides to take it

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.379
back 13.7 billion years ago back to the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.239
beginning of time itself when witness

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.420
the Big Bang but when he gets there

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.090
there's nothing at all

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.380
no energy nada completely I'm relatedly

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.030
something goes terribly wrong with the

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.320
machine and is about to explode in the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.750
last moments of his life he realizes

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.250
well hot damn this machine is the cause

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.260
of the explosion I came to look at and

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.780
the scientist says let there be light

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.730
and there is light there is another way

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.500
to approach this see one interpretation

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.360
of quantum mechanics posits that many

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.280
worlds exist parallel and simultaneous

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.810
to ours while depending on just how

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.970
varied these worlds are you may not have

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.710
to time travel at all see if there's an

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.419
arrow on infinity of parallel worlds and

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.490
almost any configuration of events that

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.020
you can think of exists in at least one

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.400
of them so it becomes a matter of

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.470
finding which one it is and stepping

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.880
into that one of those universes for

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.979
example is slightly further back in time

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.330
than this universe but an exact copy so

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.130
stepping into it announce the time

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.470
travel we haven't actually travelled in

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.520
time at all a lot of people ask if time

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.470
travel has come around in the future

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.630
where are all the time tourists today

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.460
and I say we might be the temporal

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.720
equivalent of North Korea kind of

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.220
interesting but up enough to

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.220
avoid if you think you've gone all day
