00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.440
language is weird and swearing is maybe

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.400
the weirdest thing we do with it oh most

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.120
words are fine avocado sasketch one

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.759
amphibian dog entity but use these other

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.360
words and suddenly it's all uh sir this

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.279
is a funeral that's not appropriate

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.840
language also why are you wearing that

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.760
dinosaur costume also please stop openly

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.510
taking schedule 1 substances during the

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.720
reading of the eulogy

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.880
[Music]

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.800
jesus we may as well start with perhaps

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.239
the ultimate naughty mouth noise which

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.399
we'll just substitute with the german

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.960
philosopher kant in a futile attempt to

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.600
avoid youtube demonetization the words

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.360
can't roots are probably germanic we

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.879
don't know how the word got started but

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.399
we do know that the strength of the word

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.879
has changed over time

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.800
chaucer used a cousin word quaint openly

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.039
in the 14th century shakespeare was

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.440
writing puns with it in the 17th century

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.199
and today like many swears it functions

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.120
as the lowest insult and at the same

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.719
time the highest compliment in many

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.760
parts of the world one might be called a

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.960
stupid cat but in australia he's a right

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.119
good cat is tall praise indeed same goes

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.720
for he's the [ __ ] just remove the

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.119
definite article and the meaning is

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.360
exactly the opposite likewise bollocks

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.280
can mean false information or the dog's

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.840
bollocks something brilliant then

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.840
there's [ __ ] the beloved old faithful of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.320
the english tongue it probably comes

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.280
from germanic or indo-european possibly

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.360
for to strike and it is flexible it can

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.920
function as an adjective is that a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.920
[ __ ] penguin as an adverb this

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.119
penguin is [ __ ] unhinged yo

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.520
intransitive verb this penguin [ __ ] or

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.360
even as a verbal noun that penguin has

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.600
an assault rifle i think we're about to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.119
receive quite the [ __ ] and judging by

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.720
the fact that official documents from

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.479
the middle ages mention gentlemen with

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.560
names such as the upstanding john

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.560
lefucker we can guess that like the word

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.200
can't [ __ ] probably wasn't always as

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.200
strong as it is today anyway words don't

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.280
just change in severity but they also

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.079
mutate to be nice once meant to be

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.159
foolish to amuse meant to deceive then

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.320
there's toilet a noun borrowed from the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.560
middle french word twal meaning a little

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.560
piece of cloth next it came to mean the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.560
cloth that covers a dressing table then

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.959
the things on the dressing table then

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.720
the dressing table itself then the whole

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.560
process of getting ready for the day and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.120
then morphed into its current form the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.440
disgustatorium we know and love in any

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.800
case cursing and insults probably work

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.480
not because of the sound of the words

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.480
themselves but because they are

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.640
metaphors if you screw up and the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.800
serbian person tells you you just [ __ ]

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.720
the hedgehogs back it's clearly not that

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.120
you literally crippled a poor hedgehog

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.599
but that you are in general regrettably

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.519
an idiot likewise in latin calling

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.840
someone a public poop pile clearly just

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.680
meant they were worthless or in russian

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.040
if someone threatens you with me i'm

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.959
gonna show you where the crayfish

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.040
hibernates really of course they just

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.440
mean actually i have no idea with this

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.879
one but sounds good doesn't it and some

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.560
languages don't even really have

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.360
profanity but the one we're speaking in

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.120
now does it is a technology it is a gift

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.720
because the real genius of our species

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.640
is in language and the genius of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.159
language is in cursing and it's more

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.599
complicated than that because to even

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.200
get that some words are bad in the first

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.200
place you have to understand register

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.440
phonology semantics all of which we're

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.360
doing all day every day automatically

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.360
right now in fact meaning get a load of

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.599
you 10 out of 10 no notes you're a

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.120
linguistic primate whatever happens even

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.480
if everything's gone to [ __ ] even if

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.080
you're miserably listening to this in

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.680
the bath drinking vodka and shampoo

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.159
because you ran out of mixers you have

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.319
the superpower of language meaning golly

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.319
g you are doing one hecking success

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.239
are you drinking your mother's shampoo

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.360
again

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.360
dad

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.599
shut the [ __ ] up if you're listening to

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.519
this then congratulations you've already

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.599
acquired a language but of course none

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.439
of us remember doing it really new

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.200
humans usually spend a large amount of

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.200
their time vocalizing meaningless

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.599
nonsense some people continue this far

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.280
past infancy it's called babbling even

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.680
fresh out of the oven we're already

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.759
trying to talk then between 9 and 18

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.479
months usually come our first words in

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.960
english generally mama dada or oh god i

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.759
exist make it stop by year two most of

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.080
us have at least 150 words licked and by

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.759
three we will simply not shut up then

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.320
most of us will go on to nail the four

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.400
main aspects of wordy noises phonology

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.479
that's the sound of speech semantics

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.320
that's vocabulary and meaning grammar

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.560
and syntax learning how words fit

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.800
together and pragmatics knowing what's

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.639
even appropriate to say and when and

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.600
just as children acquire language

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.680
presumably civilization had to too too

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.240
what please permit this stock image of a

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.080
confused llama to signify we don't know

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.000
so did language first begin in our

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.280
hunter-gatherer past as just simple

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.280
nouns

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.440
and what was the first language well

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.120
tamil is the oldest living language

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.360
thousands of years old even and still

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.400
spoken by about 80 million people today

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.400
but again bruh and did an enlargening of

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.520
the human brain make language possible

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.759
or did language encourage enlargements

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.080
of the brain

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.560
evolution is sociopathic but it isn't

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.479
usually wasteful so what problem did our

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.639
distant ancestors have to solve that was

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.560
so complicated we had to evolve not just

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.720
simple verbal communication but the

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.800
capacity to memorize and use thousands

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.960
and thousands of words why did our

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.800
ancestors need the ability to say uh

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.800
homies i don't mean to be egregious but

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.840
is that a rather sizable apex predator

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.479
over there rather than just ah [ __ ] lion

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.560
[ __ ] maybe it was for negotiation maybe

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.400
for laying down sick diss tracks we have

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.960
no idea then again we don't even know

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.800
where we yawn yet so you know baby steps

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.880
still if we stick with english for now

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.039
we do know a fair bit just like greek

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.240
hindi catalan and many other languages

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.759
english has its roots in

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.360
proto-indo-european

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.680
a language we've had to reconstruct

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.120
probably spoken about 6 000 years ago by

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.120
a bunch of cats who lived between the

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.720
black sea and the caspian sea through a

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.160
combination of the standard human

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.919
pastimes of wandering around and

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.560
shagging each other language families

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.400
probably grew out of proto-indo-european

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.880
germanic began to evolve then came

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.639
anglo-frisian old english middle english

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.639
and finally the patchwork tongue we're

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.080
using now and just 10 seconds of

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.840
watching what you're saying in english

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.880
will reveal what a patchwork tongue it

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.520
is do you like waffles what is do doing

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.600
there exactly you like waffles or i know

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.120
like waffles is not only more efficient

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.160
it's the structure plenty of other

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.840
languages use perfectly well or o-u-g-h

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.199
which can be used simultaneously to

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.720
spell do cough bow through and if you're

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.880
learning english at the moment i'm just

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.400
so sorry we don't get it either in fact

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.080
english is one of the only languages

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.000
that can have competitions for spelling

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.759
many languages can't do this it's too

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.400
easy because they use phonetic spelling

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:01.360
because they're not [ __ ] mental yukt

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.280
descent choreograph english stop it get

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.120
some help and it's kinda telling that

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.199
once indoctrinated into english is

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.960
madness if someone breaks the rules we

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.360
know even if we can't explain what the

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.840
rule is this sentence now become loads

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.840
weird syntax because all jumble ryan

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.680
reynolds or the fact that in english

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.080
descriptions generally have to go

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.240
opinion size age shape color origin

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.199
material purpose noun and only in that

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.240
order or we get upset a lovely big new

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:30.720
blue fluffy polyester cap bed is fine a

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.199
polyester blue catbed lovely big new

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.680
fluffy strongly suggests those thc

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.520
gummies have just kicked in hard or

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.360
register which is basically knowing

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.520
which words to use in the context of

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.960
communicating there are a few registers

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.280
in english but let's just say we're

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.879
usually talking formally or informally

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.800
and it's not always obvious which

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:50.240
register to use you may have found

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.240
yourself in one of those [ __ ]

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.400
interviews with a hey we're all friends

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.400
at the company vibe where they insist

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.560
you speak your mind and just be honest

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.360
but if they ask what you do for fun and

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.520
as requested you reply honestly well in

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.240
my free time i like smoking massive

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.240
rocks of crack cocaine

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.240
i'd say my biggest weakness is

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.919
perfectionism it is highly unlikely you

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.919
will be offered the position but

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:38.320
arguably the most interesting feature of

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.839
almost all languages is displacement or

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.080
rather we can talk about things

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:43.599
somewhere else in time and space none of

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.760
us will live to see it but we can have a

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:48.800
chat about paris in 500 years or

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.320
patagonia 500 years ago likewise you're

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.560
not here but i can tell you it's

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.240
currently 1am in europe i'm sat in front

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.080
of two monitors with a word document and

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.399
a beer the cat is sleeping on the desk

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.399
the light is fairly dim and you probably

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:02.160
imagined something like this which

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:04.240
doesn't sound like a remarkable skill

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.240
but it is it's literally telepathy it's

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.320
[ __ ] mind-reading because language

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.560
isn't just for pointing it is the ether

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.720
in which we distribute abstractions it's

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.720
possible without words even there's no

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.480
official name for an ellipsis followed

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.880
by a question mark but the meaning is

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.560
universally understood as uh what the

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.160
[ __ ] and the fact that we immediately

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.399
get this tells us that humans have

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.720
evolved way past the era of pointing and

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:29.279
entered into the age of signification

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.680
and metaphor things mean deeper things

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:34.000
sometimes was captain oates just going

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.480
for a walk was moby dick just about a

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.399
whale are those baby on board signs just

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.000
about the baby on board and if you

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:41.519
happen to be the sort of person who

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.120
likes to blow off a little steam by

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:44.959
indiscriminately careening into other

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.800
motor vehicles at top speed but you

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:49.200
suddenly notice this sign would you

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.720
avoid that car for some reason or is the

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.160
purpose of the sign really just to tell

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.320
you that the people driving the car

00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:01.360
successfully boned at least once we get

00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:04.160
it you reproduced well done etc etc etc

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.040
this is messier 13. it's a fairly

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.560
cramped globular galaxy about 25 000

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:13.440
light years away and in 1974 we detected

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.519
this signal coming from messier 13. the

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.000
signal is composed of frequency

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:20.800
modulated radio waves shifting by 10

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.560
hertz and out of this you get ones and

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.720
zeros that correspond to

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.120
1679 digits which is weird because

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.360
that's a semi-prime a number divisible

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.800
by itself one and two other prime

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.760
numbers 23 and 73. so you arrange the

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.959
ones and zeros on a grid 23 by 73

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.440
squares and you get these shapes it's

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:46.320
hard to imagine this is from a natural

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.320
astronomical event but if it's a message

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.279
it's even harder to imagine what it

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.440
means because i'm playing of course this

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:55.200
is a message we sent to messier 13 not

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.880
the other way around but it bears

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.959
hammering home that if we want to

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.200
establish contacts with intelligent life

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:03.920
beyond earth not to imply there's any on

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.880
earth universal messages are going to be

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.360
like really tricky the messier 13 signal

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.000
we sent is called the arecibo message

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.640
and it looks in full like this there are

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.120
seven components first is a primer the

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.760
numbers one to ten in binary then some

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.560
representations of human dna then an

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.880
approximation of us and our population

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.200
then our solar system and which planet

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.360
it is sending the message earth then the

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.760
aracebo radio telescope that sent the

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.600
message itself the message only has

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.920
another oh 24 955 years to go before

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.480
arriving but when it does and if it

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.800
reaches messier 13 in about 12 more

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.279
jesus cycles it's gonna be a bit of a

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.959
doozy to decode because we're assuming

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:48.880
in the first place that aliens will

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:51.519
understand that this is binary or

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.279
whatever their analog of binary is next

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:55.440
that the messier thirteeners will know

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:57.600
this is dna or that they even understand

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.519
nucleotide biology then that they will

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.519
ensure this is an organism not a

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:03.680
structure or a continent then that this

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:05.680
is a solar system not an appendage or a

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.760
reproductive organ or something and then

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.000
that this is a machine and that's all

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.920
assuming they even use symbolic language

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.079
in the first place to be fair the

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.160
message was more sent ceremonially than

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:18.399
a real hello but still when you think

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.519
about it how do you send an unambiguous

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:24.160
message to beings of unknown psychology

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:26.399
well it's bad enough with us there are a

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.399
fair few writing systems by our own

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:30.959
species that we still can't decipher

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:33.120
like bible script in lebanon or linear a

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:36.000
in crete and that's not to mention

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.720
nuclear semiotics which is the study of

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.639
well we produce a lot of nuclear waste

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.240
and the stuff we don't recycle need

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:44.240
somewhere to go because it's hella

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.399
dangerous and it stays dangerous for

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.560
thousands of years oh well we'll put it

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:50.160
somewhere then okay but in the hardly

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.240
implausible event that civilization

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.480
collapses entirely and say in the

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.639
distant future our great great great

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.639
great grandchildren discover our sights

00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:00.639
full of nuclear waste we need some way

00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:02.560
of telling them this radioactive stuff

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:04.720
will make you dead don't put it up your

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.639
bottom and if today's languages are

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.200
forgotten by them how do you write that

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:11.839
warning without words oh that's easy

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.839
just yeah really because that could mean

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:15.920
death it could also just be a drum kit

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:18.800
depending on how morbid your culture is

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.120
or okay how about this so left to right

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.040
that's obvious yeah unless they read

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.040
right to left like literally millions of

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.959
humans do today in which case it isn't

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.560
so much the nuclear waste kills you

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:30.880
rather that it brings you back from the

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.200
[ __ ] dead oh but it's obvious there's

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.600
arrows yeah what does an arrow mean if

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.760
you've never seen an actual arrow and on

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.920
top of that even if we crack universal

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.959
messaging even if aliens receive and

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.720
read our nonsense would they care we are

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:46.959
the way we are because of evolutionary

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.959
pressure because of our specific climb

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:51.279
up the tree of life we could have ended

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:52.720
up looking a thousand other ways perhaps

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:55.040
we could have ended up thinking a

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.480
thousand other ways is it universal for

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.120
other intelligent species in the

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.279
universe to be curious or linguistic or

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.519
social or even give a damn about looking

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:06.079
across the knights for other mines who

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:08.079
knows but we're trying to find them and

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:09.920
the aracebo message is hardly the only

00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:13.440
message we've sent to the heavens

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:15.680
between april 2051 and november 2069 the

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.680
human sent message cosmic call 1 will be

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.959
arriving in the constellation cygnus and

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.360
sejita respectively between july 2047

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:25.040
and february 2017 the teenage message

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.600
will make its way to the constellations

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.320
ursa major cassiopeia and a few others

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:33.040
then cosmic call 2 hello from earth and

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:36.000
a bunch more whether received or not in

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.800
transit currently are our first tries

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.880
hello our name is our fledgling

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.199
electromagnetic attempts to introduce

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.519
ourselves to the great neighborhood but

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:47.519
even then even if those messages reach

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:49.040
other beings even if those beings

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:50.800
understand what they're reading

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.360
considering just how young we are

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.440
technologically it is entirely possible

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.399
that more advanced civilizations may

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:01.120
well perceive us as babies still stuck

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:03.760
at our early vocalization stage babbling

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.680
at adults as those adults silently wait

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.320
for us to begin the quests of learning

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.959
cosmic grammar as we continue like

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.250
featherless birds chirping desperately

00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:20.780
across the dark forests

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:21.660
[Music]

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:28.589
[Applause]

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:28.589
[Music]

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:37.999
[Applause]

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:48.480
[Laughter]

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.560
talking of which perhaps you've been to

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.240
one of these fancy international meetups

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.399
that capital cities like arranging

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.480
sometimes and the native speakers of

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:58.320
widely used languages will usually seek

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.079
each other out and the brits and the

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.000
americans will inevitably start

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:03.920
chuckling amongst themselves at the tiny

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.480
differences in their vocabulary oh you

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.199
say trunk we say boot oh you say cause

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.199
light we say horse piss etc while just a

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:13.279
few feet away will be standing someone

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:15.040
who uses a completely different system

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:17.360
of writing and grammar someone from

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.880
georgia or tibet or wherever who won't

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.720
be receiving anywhere near as much

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.800
attention for some reason someone who

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.360
genuinely has linguistic differences

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.600
just look at georgian he's gorgeous it's

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.440
georgious but when it comes to language

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.920
we seem to be fascinated with similar

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.839
differences not different similars which

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.320
is maybe why for all of our looking out

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:38.160
to the stars for talking aliens we seem

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.639
a little indifferent about the fact that

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.399
aliens are sort of already here and

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:43.440
there's about eight million species of

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:45.839
them

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.399
this apprentice chunker is called freya

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:50.079
she's four years old she likes tuna and

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:52.320
when she's really chill she presents the

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:54.399
jelly beans for inspection freya has

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.320
never uttered a word before but she does

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:58.959
sort of say things to me especially when

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.959
she's hungry

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:06.959
you already have food what's this or

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:09.360
rather she's probably saying i want

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:12.400
something make you do thing i want you

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.240
bipedal furless oik if communication is

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.240
trying to put things from your head into

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.480
other heads then this is kind of

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.400
communication and though her and i share

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.799
a common ancestor and though we both

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.360
enjoy idleness and biographical dramas

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:27.520
her mind is pretty unknowable to me and

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.760
i'm quite sure her reality is unknowable

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.320
to me too if this little lion could

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.960
speak i would not understand her sort of

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.120
talking aliens are already here i live

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.200
with a sort of talking alien perhaps you

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.120
do too oh but she's not a talking

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.480
intelligent alien you might reply well

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.320
first of all what'd you say about my cat

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.480
[ __ ] you and second of all all right

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.080
then how's about ants

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.520
well there's probably about a hundred

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.120
trillion of them on earth made up of

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.039
twelve thousand species they form

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.440
alliances raid other colonies and

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:57.760
practice division of labor just like us

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.000
working as nurses foragers warriors

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.720
matey with a door for a head matey has a

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.280
door for a head and they build societies

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.520
of a sort one colony in japan reportedly

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.640
held 300 million of the suckers made of

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.480
45 000 nests across 700 acres about the

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.520
same size as mark zuckerberg's hawaiian

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:18.160
estate a thriving metropolis and how

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.799
with communication with sound touch and

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.640
chemical cues pheromones ant pheromones

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:25.039
can signal anything from alarm there's

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.520
an intruder to i done a good trail come

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:29.520
see even to propaganda pheromones lying

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.440
about allegiances to get inside other

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.440
nests oh but those aren't talking

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.520
intelligent aliens either you might say

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.520
that's just mindless group cooperation

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.000
yeah could one of us build a space

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.080
program or an airliner or even a pencil

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.559
all by ourselves we look like ants from

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.720
not that far up but all right how about

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:48.320
bees then if you're having a lovely day

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.919
out as a honey bee and you come upon

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.080
some nectar you'll want to tell your

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:54.000
mates so it's back to the hive where you

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.520
perform this figure eight dance in which

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.520
you'll communicate the richness of the

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.200
nectar with the intensity of your twerk

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.039
and the location of the nectar with the

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.440
direction of your dance relative to the

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:05.600
sun it's called the waggle dance is that

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.760
language uh it depends how you feel

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.080
about bodria after a few drinks but

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.320
either way we'll never know because the

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.679
non-human communication story ends there

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.360
with insects unfortunately

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:18.880
except of course it [ __ ] doesn't what

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.799
about electric fish who use their

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.280
electric fields to chat about anything

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:25.440
from hi i'm a boyfish or a girlfish to

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.720
we're getting attacked as simultaneously

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.400
they're trailed by sharks who have

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.400
learned to eavesdrop on these electrical

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.080
conversations or dolphins who some

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.000
researchers think are naming themselves

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.919
with entirely unique whistles rather

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.520
impressive if true considering most of

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:39.679
us don't even have an original christian

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.280
name or cuttlefish who can display two

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:43.360
totally different messages on either

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.360
sides of their bodies simultaneously or

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.120
elephants who seem to be sending seismic

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.960
distress signals with their stamps that

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.880
can travel tens of miles distantly

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.559
through the ground or chimpanzees who

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.559
can learn and utilize hundreds of

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:56.320
symbols from human sign language it's

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:58.000
debatable whether they really understand

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.840
what they're saying but in any case they

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.080
can not only count with human numbers

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.159
but can outperform humans over and over

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.000
at memorizing number sequences or of

00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:08.320
course to humpback whales and their

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.080
songs the songs are usually hierarchical

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.159
units build into phrases which build

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.760
into themes which build into songs they

00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:16.080
compose and exchange these songs

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.159
together inside populations many songs

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.840
are only sung during breeding season so

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:21.440
something to do with getting laid but

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.840
many aren't sometimes they're used

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.640
before feeding sometimes just alone and

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.640
why do they sing at all we have no idea

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.880
but if the criteria for an alien we're

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.799
interested in is can do some technology

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.200
and communication has mind we don't

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:36.960
understand and evolved from beyond earth

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.720
many animals are nailing two out of

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.559
three of these and to the third one

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.640
there our last common ancestor with

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:44.240
parrots lived probably 300 million years

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.240
ago five times as far back as the

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.000
dinosaurs went extinct our last common

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.320
link with octopuses is likely about

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.919
twice that 750 million years back

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.760
animals might not be from an alien

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:55.840
planet but many are certainly from an

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.760
alien time which is not to say that

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.520
animals will be rivaling humans any time

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.200
soon they're busy with their own [ __ ]

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.280
often literally but until

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.799
extraterrestrials message us back if

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.200
it's different similars we're looking

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:09.039
for if it's unknowable minds we're after

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.720
haven't they been here the whole time

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:12.720
and is the problem really that they're

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.960
not smart enough to speak our languages

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.840
or that we're currently too daft to

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.840
understand theirs

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.360
it's got a door

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.360
