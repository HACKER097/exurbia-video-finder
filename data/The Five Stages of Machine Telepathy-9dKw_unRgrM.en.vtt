00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Recently, blessed Father Musk, sunk a bungload of money into something called Neuralink,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.940
which is a technology designed to allow interaction between computers and your think pudding.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.460
If the optimists are right you could eventually throw Alexa out the window, and just think at your house instead,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.960
have brain-to-brain communication, also known as telepathy,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.460
you could probably even bang the lawnmower man in convincing VR.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.580
But, it does get one thinking, doesn't it?

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.020
We're excited about Stage One. Right?

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.260
So controlling stuff with your brain.  Which we can do a bit already.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.360
Some subjects have been able to move robot arms with their thoughts, and drag cursors around and stuff.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.680
It would be cool to have a consumer version of that.  Fine.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.600
BUT.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.800
If this technology improves, then there's Stage Two.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.660
Which is 'exportation of abstract thought.'

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.360
Or just 'thinking' at a computer monitor, and your homework being spat out by magic.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.780
Or recording dreams, or feelings, or the smell of your mum's special kangaroo lasagna, or whatever.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.940
𝘞𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘩 𝘢𝘭𝘴𝘰 𝘥𝘰𝘦𝘴 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨, 𝘥𝘰𝘦𝘴𝘯'𝘵 𝘪𝘵?

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.200
Because at Stage Three, you could take further - if this stuff works.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.140
With some kind of advanced brain cap, distance wouldn't matter anymore.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.740
If you really wanted to, you could presumably start storing memories, maybe in someone else's head,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.000
or sharing memories - if we knew how memories work - or dreaming with someone else,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.280
or combining your senses with another person's, or having constant mental conversations with other humans.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.620
You could have two minds joined across thousands of miles.  Continuous sharing of subjective experience, or:

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.540
*FUSION HUMANS*

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.480
You could create a blend of humans where the mental boundary is so blurry they're basically the same human.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.020
They share common memories, common thoughts in real time, a common self.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.200
Two brains, one identity.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.020
𝙒𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙝 𝘿𝙊𝙀𝙎 𝙜𝙚𝙩 𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜, 𝙙𝙤𝙚𝙨𝙣'𝙩 𝙞𝙩?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.580
At Stage Four, if this stuff works, well, surely mad humans will just opt to give up their sense of subjective identity, to become part of the whole.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.540
To just stay constantly connected to a network of brains in real time.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.500
Which seems a little bit like the beginning of a new species, doesn't it?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.020
Together, they'd be more intelligent, more perceptive, able to pool their resources, just all around superior to us single-brained plebs.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.920
Personally I can't think of any examples in science fiction where this has gone wrong. Ever!

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.780
So, it's probably fine.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.280
The point is, maybe we're watching the beginning of a full-on existential shift,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.440
in how humans live, and think, and what it even means, fundamentally, to be one.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.600
Even weirder, computers will be serving as translators in this scenario,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.120
making my thoughts, even digestable for your brain in the first place, and vice versa.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.440
And we'd have to place a lot of trust in machines, and presumably A.I at that point, so that it doesn't just become a 'Chinese Whisper' situation.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.720
Little scary.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.220
𝙒𝙃𝙄𝘾𝙃 𝘿𝙊𝙀𝙎 𝙂𝙀𝙏 𝙊𝙉𝙀 𝙏𝙃𝙄𝙉𝙆𝙄𝙉𝙂, 𝘿𝙊𝙀𝙎𝙉'𝙏 𝙄𝙏,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.460
about using this technology, not just to communicate with other humans,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.720
not just to flush the loo with your mind,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.500
but to merge with technology itself.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.800
Yes, come on, take a little sip of the Transhuman Kool-Aid, just for funsies.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.480
In Stage Five, if this stuff works, at this point the gap between human and machine is very, very vague, indeed.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.920
And what you may have built isn't just a mental internet,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.260
or compelling VR,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.040
or even an Alexa replacement,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.400
but a planetary superorganism, composed of humans, and electronics.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.680
An internet made of meat, and silicon.  It's happened before on the planet, already.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.540
Cells used evolution to unify into organs, notably brains,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.760
well, humans might in this case, be single-cells right now.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.340
Just waiting to amass into a unified superorganism using future interface technology.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.060
Might be amazing, might not work at all,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.020
might be a disaster of tremendous proportions heralding the anti-climactic disappearance of our species.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.880
But don't worry!

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.180
Luckily technology has never brought any downsides with it, ever.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.260
And we never misuse our discoveries.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.040
We definitely aren't living in the most unpredictable, and insane period in human history yet,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.260
and mental interface technology definitely won't make it weirder!

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.220
So let's just dive in, shall we?

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.700
Anything is possible,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.940
Everything might kill us,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.880
Love and kisses xxx

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.440
_Resistance is futile_
