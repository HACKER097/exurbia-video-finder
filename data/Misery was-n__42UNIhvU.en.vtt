00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Anxious?

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Dissatisfied?

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.800
Tired of waking up in that hotbed of mindless drudgery and tedium you've affectionately come to refer to as

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.180
"your life"?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.920
Convinced that everyone else has their ducks in a row,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.340
while you lurch from disaster to disaster like some rickety tandem Victorian velocipede?

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.480
Caught in a perpetual cycle of feeling good,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.420
feeling medium,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.120
then returning to feeling like crap again,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.940
waiting for the day when you'll actually find yourself in a good mood for more than five minutes?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.820
Well, there is quite a good reason for some of that,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.900
and it begins, as we all did,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.140
with biology.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.920
Nature uses two methods of making babies on our planet:

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.420
"boink" and "no boink".

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.020
"No boink", or asexual reproduction, is generally used by bacteria, plants, and fungi,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.600
and it involves an organism copying its genetic material for the next generation.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.580
"Boink", or sexual reproduction, usually involves a male and a female doing the nasty

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.240
and combining their DNA 50/50 to produce offspring.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.860
And that's the one we'll focus on here.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.040
Species change over time due to two main factors: selection and mutation.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.540
Selection means the organisms better suited to their environment have more chance of surviving – and so, reproducing.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.640
They will also often choose mating partners with what they consider attractive qualities, or "phenotypes".

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.260
For example, often deer like big antlers,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.900
peahens like colorful plumage,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.580
the male bowerbird attempts to attract ladies in the form of a bachelor pad called a bower,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.660
which takes sometimes months to decorate.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.960
Stupid birds!

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.620
Humans would never make such silly displays for mating purposes!

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.480
Would... we?..

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.620
The second trick is mutation.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.860
Mutation means that sometimes there are glitches in the DNA of offspring,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.760
and this could be due to copying errors, or even cosmic rays.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.280
In humans, it can mean anything from red hair to genetic diseases.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.180
Sometimes these mutations will then be passed down to the next generation of offspring,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.020
and, if they're beneficial for survival, will be sexually selected,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.800
and even become a characteristic feature of the species.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.980
Through circumstances we still don't understand, humans have developed relatively large brains

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.640
and outsmarted, nom'd, or avoided every other species on the planet –

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.400
good old survival of the shittest.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.960
And while we pride ourselves on being fantastically clever,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.740
very little has actually changed in terms of hardware between prehistoric humans and modern humans,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.180
because evolution takes ages, as we know.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.420
Now, modern humans are sneaky, of course:

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.280
we've taken the old evolutionary urges and drives, and found ways to still enjoy them.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.180
Aggressive combat into competitive martial arts, for example.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.300
Or a constant obsession with reproduction

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.640
turned into an act you can do thousands of times across your lifespan, and never actually make offspring.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.340
But evolution is not a smart or conscious process –

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.160
some things are NOT well-designed.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.500
A narrow pelvis, for example, making childbirth a thoroughly enjoyable experience for women everywhere.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.780
Or standing up, which, in return for a better line of sight and an ability to grab stuff,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.960
also kindly gave us sciatica and hemorrhoids in return.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.060
However, we've also inherited the mental traits evolution kindly gave to our ancestors,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.440
including creativity,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.260
curiosity,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.040
speech,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500
a low anxiety threshold,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.160
a bit of a tendency for pessimism,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.420
and a total inability to keep right on the London Underground escalators.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.180
The signs are fucking everywhere!!

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.660
We are a contradictory mix of animal and mad god.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.460
But we may be, this century, on the threshold of gaining technologies to alter our evolutionary blueprint,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.520
courtesy of genetic engineering.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.920
Going into our genome and ripping up the floorboards.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.040
So what shall we do then?

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.480
Make ourselves harder, better, faster, stronger;

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.460
eyes on elbows;

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.840
an ability to actually piss in a straight line first thing in the morning – all very interesting,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.300
but there is one particular evolutionary bad boy we might rewire,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.060
that's so fundamental to the human condition we barely even notice it's there.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.140
And its name...

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.460
is "misery".

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.460
We are not designed for sustained happiness or optimism.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.940
Natural selection had very little interest in our mental welfare – survival was key.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.780
As a result, it seems most of us, regardless of geography or social standing, have a hedonic set point –

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.460
that is, something good might happen, and you'll feel good for a while;

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.900
something bad might happen, and you'll feel bad for a while;

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.660
but eventually you will probably return to your baseline, which appears to be set out of your control –

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.020
partly genetically.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.620
For some individuals, this set point is rather high;

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.120
for the rest of us, though...

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.100
Yeah, not...

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.700
NOT SO MUCH.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.820
And that's ignoring all the other pitfalls of brain 1.0,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.380
including age-related dementia,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.280
self-loathing,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.840
a tendency towards addiction,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.440
a tendency towards addiction...

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.260
A TENDENCY TOWARDS ADDICTION!..

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.520
low boredom thresholds,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.600
and everything else we didn't ask for, genetically speaking.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.940
These nasties have haunted us for millennia,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.520
and they seem to form part of what we've lovingly come to know as the human condition,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.760
which for many of us is just shorthand for

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.360
"stuff we can't change, and we're shit, and it's natural,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.020
and have a cup of tea and get on with it."

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.040
But if we crack the ability to send these evolutionary dishes back to the kitchen,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.620
to engineer ourselves happier or more content...

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.900
Shall we fucking give it a whirl, or... not?

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.340
After all, we've got such a great track record with limiting the few godlike powers we already have...

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.380
*ahem...*

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.300
*ahem..*

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.280
*ahem.*

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.980
*ahem*

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.540
*cough-cough*

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.500
*ahem*

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.600
*cough*

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.500
If we do gain mastery over our own genetics,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.180
how far should we go with this one?

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.160
And... how the hell will we know... when to stop?

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.820
Now, luckily, genetic engineering is really simple, and there are no risks,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.100
and genetic engineering is really simple

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.260
You see, there's a single gene for everything:

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.420
a cleverness gene, a tallness gene, a really good-looking gene,

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.560
and they can just be turned on and off without affecting anything else, and there being no bad consequences,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.880
and genetic engineering is really simple –

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.340
there's definitely no risk of making horrific alterations to the human genome that only become apparent generations later,

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.400
there's no risk of nasty folks creating engineered drug resistant pandemics that are virtually impossible to eradicate,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.780
there's certainly no risk of a group of us getting hold of the technology and creating an entirely separate genus of humans

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.860
we can't possibly compete with in any aspect whatsoever.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.220
Genetic engineering is unbelievably complicated, and it's not hard to see why people are extremely cautious.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.600
We are currently children who have just about learned the genetic alphabet, but we can't read yet.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.800
So what can the new genetic technologies actually do?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.940
Well, in each of our cells is DNA.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.720
DNA is packed within chromosomes.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.160
Chromosomes are extremely long strings of DNA composed of four bases:

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.500
A, T, C, and G.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.800
Lengths of these are called "genes", and proteins are built inside your body as a result of genes.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.420
If you like, genes are genetic verbs telling proteins what to do.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.840
We've been genetic engineers for four centuries now,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.640
breeding species for the sake of characteristics we want – in doggies, for example:

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.080
small ones,
big ones,
the bestest ones...

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.720
...fucking love Springer Spaniels...

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.600
But even that goes wrong sometimes.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.440
Many species of doggies are adorable,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.100
but possess nasty inherited traits like hip dysplasia and epilepsy – thanks to us.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.640
And this is just simple genetic engineering we haven't managed to get right yet.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.160
So far, we've been using hammer methods, but now we may be holding a scalpel method called CRISPR,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.080
and it works – roughly, briefly – like so:

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.020
Some bacteria can store an intruder's DNA in their own DNA in the genetic library called CRISPR,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.840
or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.560
and using that as a template, using an enzyme called Cas9 it can kick ass if the intruder comes around again.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.920
Researchers have hijacked this trick, and have begun to use it to snip out targeted sections of DNA in other organisms.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.600
Considering there are thousands of diseases caused by a mistake of just one letter,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.420
not too much alteration might be needed to fix all sorts of nasties latent in human DNA.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.280
This isn't a question of IF we start radically altering human biology – it's WHEN,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.540
because even if most of us condemn the technology, it's not as if other researchers won't pursue it –

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.880
they've started already.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.120
Obviously, hopefully, we'll begin with eliminating genetic disorders,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.440
but surely there will come a point, perhaps this century, when we get a little bit more experimental.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.440
And the question is, what happens then?

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.200
Well, we might be children at the moment,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.440
but we know enough to notice that certain genes, when they're present, accompany specific traits.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.360
DEC2, for example, is a genetic mutation allowing some of the humans who have it to survive on around 6 hours sleep a night.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.300
But genetics is rarely "one gene equals one trait".

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.980
There isn't one intelligence gene,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.120
and there probably isn't going to be a single "depression" or "makes hummus delicious" gene, either.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.760
What we know from twin studies, though, is that somehow very specific traits CAN be inherited.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.720
There may not be a single "good at violin" gene,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.680
but there might be a bunch of genes that go INTO being good at the violin

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.440
that one might inherit from their parents, like decent hand-eye coordination and pitch sensitivity.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.300
But in any case genetics is not a switchboard –

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.140
happy on, sad off, bada-bing, let's go for a pint –

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:09.260
it is an interconnected tapestry in which some traits are caused by loads of genes, potentially thousands,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.240
and small alterations could have horrific consequences.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.840
There's nothing prudish about being cautious when it comes to a cheeky bit of the old "playing God".

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.280
Let's plant a flag there for a moment,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.580
because if we do one day learn to speak fluent Genetics, alongside changing ourselves physically,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.020
(and potentially shepherding in the FUCKING APOCALYPSE!)

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.940
We could scout out the roots of the more unpleasant aspects of the human condition –

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:30.960
of low mood,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.840
of self-hate,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.600
of depression,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.420
anxiety,

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.560
of the hedonic curse –

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.360
of the genetic foundations of misery itself.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.340
And if for some reason this all goes well – which there's no reason to suggest that it has to –

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.640
then you and I might be living in the last century

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.500
in which anyone was ever involuntarily suffering, mentally speaking.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.240
Mental well-being is, I would argue, the most important factor in being alive,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.280
because it's the first thing that makes being alive WORTH being alive.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.180
Like, if you weren't conscious, nothing else would matter.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.920
And even if you lived in a solid-gold mansion, and slept on a bed made of Fabergé eggs, and brushed your teeth with dolla dolla bills –

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.160
if you're miserable, you're still miserable.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.000
Gucci gang, Gucci gang.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.980
If there's a possibility of one day altering the human condition,

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.920
perhaps the goal should be to preserve our humanity, but attempt to overthrow our evolutionary curses.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.000
For example, using these new technologies to raise an individual's baseline happiness default

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.480
without compromising the individual's personality.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.220
Much like the difference between you with a hangover and you after a workout, and-

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.380
Oh! Is that Aldous Huxley at the door with some reasonable criticisms?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.120
No, he can sod off, thank you – this is wild speculation.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.260
Then again, some pain makes sense.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.780
If one is sat around eating crisps and gaming all day,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.600
it might be entirely appropriate to have that nagging feeling that time is being wasted –

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.900
a form of deep evolutionary signaling to go out and actually engage with the human tribe.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.360
Or if you've lost someone close to you, you know that grieving is horrible,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.840
but it gives you time to try and make sense of who you've lost,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.800
and in the end you can hopefully come to terms with it in a psychologically healthy way.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.200
There are plenty of sensible warning messages written into the human psyche,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.600
But others are overcompensations, or just bad genetic luck.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.440
What the hell is the beneficial aspect of lifelong depression, for example?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.100
Oh, it's time for a disclaimer!

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.080
There's a trend in media that I, and perhaps you, find a bit irritating,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.220
which is when someone will be pretending to be objective,

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.240
but really just trying to beat some kind of pet theory of theirs into your head,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.940
labeling it "philosophy", or "common sense", or something, and using fancy big words.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.860
What comes next is purely my, and a few other people's, crackpot theory and speculation,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.240
and that's... it.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.600
And real researchers, with actual qualifications in the field of genetics who don't have enough time to make Youtube videos

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.000
'cause they're actually busy doing something beneficial for humanity,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.360
are rightly careful about speculation, because the real world is really complicated,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.740
and they're frankly probably rightly fed up with champagne futurist types like myself

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.540
making wild speculations about the future while facing no consequences for being wrong.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.860
There is no reason to think genetic engineering will be chocolate and cat cuddles.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.460
It could go badly in a million ways for a million reasons,

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.880
and if you're using this channel for educational purposes in the first place,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.020
you have to be totally bonkers, because it's just me,

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.640
the cat,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.700
some cuddles with the cat,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.440
shit I like yelling into a microphone about,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.280
no qualifications whatsoever in genetics,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.180
and a big ol' box of fucking Tofifee.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.440
Purely.
Speculation.
Ahead.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.360
Awight?

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.380
Awight.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.860
That being said, though...

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.220
In the event that we do develop competency with these new genetic tools,

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.440
the future of biology is going to be stranger than we're even capable of imagining.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.080
If genetic engineering becomes accessible to citizens – to us –

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.600
what the hell happens then?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.220
Perhaps there'll come a whole new generation of artists

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.640
who use technology as a brush, and the human mind as their canvas,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.900
in which entirely novel degrees of bliss and well-being will be possible –

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.640
and, of course, new degrees of suffering and horror.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.180
We might isolate the molecular structure of bliss and proliferate it,

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.120
we might isolate the molecular structure of misery... and kill it.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.280
We may become capable of experiencing emotions we don't even have words for yet.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.580
Degrees of euphoria light-years beyond anything drugs can provide today.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:54.200
We know from psychedelics and sleep that the human mind is capable of entering alien dream-time spaces –

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.180
spaces unconstrained by our usual evolutionary baseline architecture.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.760
Tomorrow's genetic explorers may go in search of these spaces,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.160
rewiring the perceptual and reward centers of their brains.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.380
If that happens, it will seem bizarre to them

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.480
that for the whole of our history we occupied only the ground floor of human experience,

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.840
and except for the occasional hallucinogenic dabbling,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.040
never took the elevator up or down to those other strange floors –

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.460
to boundless optimism,

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.940
to entire lifetimes free of self-loathing or anxiety,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.200
ignorant of the molecular and genetic foundations of misery,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.900
much in the fashion that disease was once thought caused by bad smells;

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.180
back when we lived in an era in which we had more control over the atom

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.960
than we had over our own internal circuitry;

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.880
that somehow we survived the psychochemical Dark Ages.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.600
Will we lose ourselves to radical transformation?

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.560
Will we venture too far into the experimental forest –

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.900
a world in which we fracture into so many variations of humanity

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.840
we can no longer communicate with each other,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.060
a world in which one can make a living scouting out these new strange humans,

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.580
much as an anthropologist seeks our new cultures today?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.060
We have no idea.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.000
We are a limited species who may be about to gain unlimited power.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.640
And what happens then?

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.840
What becomes of the human condition when the genetic shackles have been taken off?

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.500
There will be plenty of moral problems of technology for our children's children to face,

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.880
but one of them is bound to be the issue of human modification,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.920
and, by extension, modification of the human condition.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.520
We currently have no compass to show us the way,

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.040
as we set out on this new, very possibly perilous expedition

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.140
into our own source code.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.720
As John says in Brave New World:

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.000
"But I don't want comfort.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.380
I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.520
I want freedom, I want goodness.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.700
I want sin."

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.700
And why should we edit out the strange edges of the human condition?

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.360
We are a uniquely batshit species, and that is lovely.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.760
But there is a difference between eccentricity

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.060
and suffering at the hands of a mental legacy we inherited from nature.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.920
We still bear the evolutionary scars of our rise through the ranks of the animals,

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.820
of our helpless infancy in the ocean,

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.220
and then of our traumatic childhood on the savannah plains of Africa.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.020
and as a result of those millions of years of ruthless evolutionary pressure,

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:11.020
we have matured into a very peculiar mix of aggression and diplomacy,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.060
willful ignorance and curiosity,

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.800
chaos and smarts.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.280
We have enough problems today as it is.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.320
Just considering disease and mortality, gastroenteritis alone kills about 1.8 million kids a year,

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.580
and that's to say nothing of cancer, malaria, and tuberculosis.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.660
But slowly, thanks to the conscientious among us, they are on the run.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.700
And it is conceivable that one day humans will live on a planet free of disease

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.960
and free of premature death at the hands of nature.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.300
And as we relegate these demons to history,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:46.240
we will surely pause to cast an eye on those involuntary mental maladies as well –

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.780
the specters of despair, of depression, of anxiety –

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.460
and wonder if we might banish those, too.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.720
"Was" must be the most lovely word in the English language.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.300
It tells you everything you need to know about our ingenuity and compassion as a species.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:06.660
If you look up smallpox today, often the first two words of the definition will read "smallpox was".

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.520
"Was".

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.120
We collectively gave it a fucking roundhouse kick and yelled: "stay down, you c**t!"

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.420
And it stayed down.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.620
If everything goes well as we mature as a species,

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.580
the word "was" will propagate steadily throughout our encyclopedias.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.020
And perhaps centuries from today, some future child will stumble on some future incarnation of Wikipedia

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.700
and come upon obscure and forgotten diseases and afflictions of the human being –

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.680
couched again and again, relentlessly,

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.000
in the wonderful past tense:

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:43.900
"Cancer was a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. These contrasted with benign tumors, which..."

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:51.000
"Malaria was a mosquito-borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals, caused by single-celled microorganisms belonging to..."

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.580
"Alzheimer's disease was a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually started slowly and gradually worsened..."

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.960
"Measles was a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the..."

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.420
"Huntington's disease was an inherited disorder that resulted in the deaths of..."

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.980
"Tuberculosis was an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria..."

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:20.540
"Misery was an involuntary state of mental distress common to humans of all eras and circumstances.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:27.500
Its eradication marked the beginning of the banishment of the existential horrors from the human condition."

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.200
What up, thanks for sitting through my bullshit this month.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.400
So, last year I put out an e-book called "The Fifth Science".

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.080
It's not for me to say if it was a good book, but it was the one I most enjoyed writing,

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.920
and I'm very excited to say it's now available as a paperback, with a new cover and a new introduction.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.920
If you are interested, there is a link below.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.480
It's a load of short stories about waking the universe up,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.960
and more than that I can't say; I just really, really hope you like it.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.360
As a little celebration, with some help, I have hidden copies of the book in the UK, Germany, and Bulgaria.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.840
If you can find them, they're yours – links in the description for how to do that.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:12.000
I've disabled comments on the clue videos so you can't help each other, you little scamps. Good luck...

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.320
Thank you to everyone who's bothered with the book already –

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.800
I read all of your emails, and they are much appreciated;

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.600
and thank you to those of you on Patreon, obviously, because this book definitely wouldn't exist without you.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.320
If you want to try a story from the book first, there is a link below to me reading one,

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.280
and if not – fair enough, it might be shit. You don't know.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.880
I hope you're doing well in any case, and all the very, very best wishes from myself and the feline –

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.820
well, not from her, she's a fucking sociopath, but from me! From me.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.680
Bai...
