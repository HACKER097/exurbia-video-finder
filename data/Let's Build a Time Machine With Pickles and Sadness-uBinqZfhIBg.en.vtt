00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
1. Locate Pickles. Quantity: two.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.840
2. Locate shelf.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.500
3. Optionally, locate Bulgarian science juice,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.560
for... s-sciencing.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.260
ЕБАСИ МАЙКАТА! (Bulgarian: MOTHERFUCKER!)

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.140
4. Place pickle 1 on floor.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.160
5. Place pickle 2 on high shelf.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.800
Congratulations, you now own a time machine.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.440
Ah, Turtle Boi has finally had his big December stroke, eh?

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.020
No – not yet, anyway.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.320
It's called "General Relativity," and...

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.860
well, y'see...

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.540
Catching a flight recently, I noticed there was no Row 13 in front of me – clearly a superstition thing.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.835
"Oh, that's great," I thought.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.280
"They build planes based on magic these days, do they?

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.640
What keeps this one in the air?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.800
Ectoplasm? Pixies under the wings?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.700
If I visit the lavatory, shall I perchance encounter two unicorns engaged in frantic coitus?"

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
But, to be honest, science is just magic that works.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.460
It's the reason why pickle 2 is really travelling in time.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.640
Now, let's divide the world into "Magic 1" and "Magic 2".

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.720
Magic 1 is crazy stuff we believe, because it seems legit,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.740
but we tested it, and it appeared to be bollocks.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.840
Like "13 is bad luck for some reason",

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.480
or "you can cure diabetes by licking a squid".

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.460
Magic 2 is crazy stuff we believe because even though it's counter-intuitive,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.480
all evidence and experimental data points in that direction.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.700
Like "the universe probably began from a point of infinite density 14 billion years ago",

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.940
or "anything but full-fat milk in tea can eat my ass".

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.680
That pickle on the ground is travelling through time slower than the pickle on the shelf.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.280
All thanks to Albert Einstein.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.220
Matter and energy distort spacetime,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.420
and we can actually prove all this using two atomic clocks and a mountain.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.900
Since a mountain is further from the center of Earth's mass than my apartment, being higher up,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.220
time should run slightly faster on the peak of the mountain than in my apartment.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.780
And since I live near a mountain, and managed recently to get hold of two atomic clocks,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.900
we're going to leave one atomic clock running on the ground in my apartment,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.725
and take the other one up the mountain, and measure the difference in time,

00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:46.200
and prove Einstein correct,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.900
and try to convince you that magic does exist.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.840
So, off we go on a cliche pop-science adventure!

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.640
Chop-chop!

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.140
(...you pricks...)

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.180
For most of history, we believed that time is uniform, moving at a constant rate for all observers.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.900
We now know that's bollocks, thanks to this gentleman.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.960
He played the violin,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.020
he never wore socks,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.440
his favorite pastime was rolling Nobel prizes up and smoking them.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.520
By 1915, Einstein already knew that the speed of light is the same in all reference frames.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.060
That means whatever your speed is, relative to light,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.240
light will ALWAYS be travelling away from you at about 300 million meters per second.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.040
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.060
THE FUCK, IS GOD HIGH??

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.320
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.260
This is called "Special Relativity."

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.840
If light travels at a constant speed, no matter your speed relative to it,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.220
the universe compensates by increasing your mass and slowing time down for you as you accelerate.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.800
Special Relativity is the reason why if you sent a baby off, going at 99% the speed of light,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.440
it would come back to Earth eventually still a baby,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.400
while its sibling, having stayed on Earth,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.540
will be middle-aged.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.360
Or old.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.540
Or dead, hu-hyuk!

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.360
But that was just his first trick, because next he comes up with "General Relativity",

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.640
which applies to stuff that isn't necessarily moving,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.380
like our time-travelling pickles.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.160
And he realizes that it isn't just moving fast that messes with time and distance –

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.440
it's matter and energy themselves.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.140
And a new door opened in reality.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.480
The thing to remember here is that from your perspective,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.960
if you feel something pulling your feetsies down to the ground, and you're blindfolded,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.000
you can't tell the difference between whether you're going up in a lift wicked fast, or just being pulled down by a planet's mass –

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.160
gravity, in other words.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.040
This is called the "Principle of Equivalence."

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.740
Acceleration and gravity feel like the same force subjectively, even though they're not,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.940
because gravity is the curvature of spacetime,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.820
making gravity a product of the geometry of spacetime.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.040
Einstein then produced his field equations, which model the relationship between matter and the geometry of spacetime with this new curvature idea,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.600
and when you apply this model to the universe, everything changes.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.000
Just take GPS satellites, for example.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.240
Since they're further from Earth's mass, time runs slightly faster for them than us,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.760
thanks to General Relativity.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.080
If engineers didn't correct for this, the GPS on your phone would probably be off by about 10 kilometers every day.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.180
But the real changes came to cosmology.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.960
From Einstein's work, we now know that mass and energy are manifestations of the same thing,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.160
that because of time dilation, the Earth's core is probably about 2.5 years younger than its crust,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.240
that light warps around stars and massive bodies in an effect called "gravitational lensing",

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.580
that sometimes stars collapse and produce black holes,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.620
that our current universe probably began from a spacetime singularity billions of years prior,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.840
that right now, the heavens are awash with invisible gravitational waves

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.680
that fall out of black hole collisions and kissing neutron stars

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.820
and perturbations in the oceans of the universe.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.200
And all of this dreamt up by a sopless, violin-playing oddball working in the Swiss patent office over a century ago,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.900
confirming mathematically that there is no master frame of reference in the whole of creation,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.140
and time, the one thing we always assumed is as fundamental as it gets,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.380
is really an entirely relative phenomenon.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.420
And sure enough, if we measure our atomic clock on the ground, perhaps only a few hours have passed,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.080
but up here on the mountain, thanks to time dilation, we in fact find that there's...

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.860
no difference whatsoever,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.200
because I can't afford an atomic clock,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.760
much less two atomic clocks.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.880
Besides, the time discrepancy at this height would be minuscule.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.200
It's there, people have measured it, paper below, but not me and not today.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.520
Also, that isn't even me on the mountain – I just found the footage online,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.560
because I couldn't be bothered walking up it today!

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.160
Because I'm... unmotivated.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.760
But... you know what? YOU try turning 30.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.900
Just waking up in the morning is a FUCKING MIRACLE!

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.480
Now, General Relativity is a Magic 2 story.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.340
It sounds ridiculous, but it has been verified – most of it.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.280
Space and time really are bendable, malleable things.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.840
But there's another Magic 2 story that is arguably even more insane.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.960
And, since you're still here, and clearly have shit taste in YouTube content,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.660
let's take a quick jaunt into particle physics!

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.900
Firstly, please try to imagine the universe as fields on fields with fields on top.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.600
Sometimes, there's an excitation in a field, and out pops a particle.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.960
Particles come in two teams: Team Fermion, and Team Boson.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.720
Why?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.040
Who fucking knows.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.220
Fermions make stuff. They build matter.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.000
This includes stuff like the electron, neutrino, and the six flavors of quarks.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.160
"Quarks? What are they?"

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.540
I'm glad you asked. They make up famously protons and neutrons – the nucleus of atoms.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.420
Quarks are held together by the strong force, mediated by gluons (we'll get there shortly),

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.120
but really, atoms are essentially quarks and electrons.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.500
Then there's Team Boson.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.720
Bosons glue nature together... sort of?

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.580
Generally, they carry the fundamental forces of the universe.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.860
The photon carries electromagnetism, for example.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.020
The W and Z bosons carry the weak force,

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.840
and the Higgs boson carries mass.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.260
Pedantic interlude!

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.620
Maybe you keep hearing people saying "The Higgs boson gives stuff mass in the universe."

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.200
Firstly, remember the Higgs boson is an excitation of the Higgs FIELD.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.260
So it's the Higgs FIELD that gives stuff mass.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.680
Imagine a big sticky pool of honey that the other particles are trying to move through.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.200
BUT!

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.140
The Higgs field doesn't give EVERYTHING mass. In fact, most of the mass in the universe doesn't come from the Higgs field.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.380
Anyway, moving on.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.220
So, ultimately,  this is the standard-

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.600
NO, FUCK IT, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.820
Remember, protons and neutrons are made of quarks,

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.540
and quarks do interact with the Higgs field... a bit?

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.000
But the rest of the mass of the proton and neutron come from quarks interacting with the carriers of the strong force, gluons,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.900
turning energy into mass from the interaction,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.220
and as we know from this guy, you can make a lot of energy from a little bit of mass.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.480
It's not important, but just...

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.540
the Higgs doesn't give everything mass,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.860
and... Han shot first,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.860
and... punk's not dead,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.940
and semi-skim milk in tea can eat my ass!

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.120
This is the standard model of particle physics as it stands today.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.940
These are the ingredients of the world.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.220
Six quarks, six leptons, four gauge bosons, and a cheeky little Higgs boson.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.760
But wait, there's more! ;)

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.240
Because as we discussed, the universe is really the result of fields,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.940
and these, as far as we know, are the basic quantum fields of nature,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.260
which we eventually end up calling humans, and La Sagrada Familia,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.640
and that green shit you find in your eyes in the morning.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.520
(It's called rheum, by the way – fun fact for you...)

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.480
This is the bedrock of nature as we know currently.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.480
These are the underlying quantum fields.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.820
They represent the three generations of particles.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.020
Throw in the four interactions, or forces of nature, that we discussed,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.480
and you have a universe.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.220
Now, the obvious question is, "Sorry, what the hell?! Why set nature up like this?"

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.260
And, "Is there something more fundamental than quantum fields?"

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.300
DO YOU KNOW about stuffing?

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.700
It is a traditional Christmas food back in my landmass of origin,

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.660
and perhaps it's popular in your country, too. I don't know.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.360
But my grandfather made,  oo-wee, the finest stuffing around,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.480
and we asked him every Christmas, "Hey, what's in this?"

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.260
And he always replied, "I'll tell you on my deathbed."

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.180
And, well, eventually he ended up on his deathbed, and a rather astute member of my family said,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.740
"Obviously, sorry about all this... dying business, but what's in your famous stuffing?"

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.200
And he paused, and he said,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.520
"Pffft, I dunno, I just throw in whatever's left in the fridge that year!"

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.800
We really like finding beauty in nature.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.500
It is the engine of mathematical and scientific  discovery,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.720
and we usually assume if a theory is beautiful, it must be correct.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.540
But really, the question is: down at the bedrock, at the bottom of everything,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.560
why WOULD nature be beautiful?

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.340
Not to forget, beauty appears fairly relative to the time and culture you grow up in.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.840
But whatever the case, it will be wonderful if there is some elegant, underlying, integral beauty to the world.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.920
But what a bummer it would be, if actually, fundamentally,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.980
nature is just... whatever was left in the fridge.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.600
But either way, we will endeavor to find out.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.100
And thanks to the development of the scientific method,

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.340
we now know how to.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.580
Ahhh yes! We've done the introductory jokes,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.320
the recycled pop-science bit,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.520
time for the pseudointellectual absurdist outro, is it?

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.480
Cattington! Fetch me my shouting socks!

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.900
From Indonesia to Australia to Russia,

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.600
we find caves decorated in strange hunting scenes,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.620
many of them twenty, thirty, forty thousand years old.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.080
We don't know what the ancients were doing,

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.540
but some theories suggest that maybe these paintings were an attempt at magic, probably to make hunting more successful –

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.220
the first evidence we have of humans trying to utilize a science to control the world around them.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.500
How far we've come since our early attempts of magic.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.040
And what beautiful things we found along the way.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.940
Turns out time isn't an absolute,

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.200
and reality is made of fields and interactions,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.780
and who knows what else?

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.800
Nature is bigger than we ever could have imagined,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.880
and more elaborate than we ever could have imagined.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.600
And despite the successes of our theories of reality, we are once again lost in the forest.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.720
Quantum mechanics still won't hold hands with General Relativity yet.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.940
On top of that, there's a large percentage of the universe that's either invisible,

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.140
or there's something wrong with our conception of gravity.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.640
We have no idea what particles are doing, or ARE, before we observe them.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.800
We have no idea why the expansion of the universe is accelerating.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.640
But you know what?

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.940
If we make it that long, in 500 years many of these questions will be answered.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.240
And though we can't guess at what those answers will be yet,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.280
it seems very unlikely they will be Magic 1 explanations,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.360
because none of them have been so far.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.640
Do the planets really affect human destiny?

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.520
Who knows. But it's unlikely Saturn's current position is the reason your dog pooped on the carpet this morning.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.880
Are aliens here already?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.220
Who can say. But it's rather hard to believe they mastered interstellar travel,

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.900
and traversed the galaxy, in faster-than-light star ships, to come to this planet

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.300
to look specifically up YOUR ARSE.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.980
It does rather seem sometimes like the less our species knows about a thing, the more certain we are of it.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.300
We're totally unique biologically on this planet-

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.540
Oh, no, we're not.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.360
Well, at least the Sun goes around our planet-

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.360
No, it doesn't.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.000
Well, at least we're at the center of everything cosmically, then-

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.620
Sorry, no, we live in a galactic suburb.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.620
You know, should we just start a religion?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.040
Oh, come on: rampant egomania, thinly veiled behind British self-deprecation –

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.200
you knew this was coming.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.220
And anyone can join this religion, and everyone gets a free cat.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.960
And there's no rules except for one, which is,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.600
if you find yourself in conversation with another human,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.000
who is boldly making declarations about things that are still totally unknown,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.520
as if we got to this point by just making things up and being confident about them,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.260
"Ahhhh, consciousness is so simple! How haven't scientists worked it out?" etc., etc.,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.220
You just reply,

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.180
"NOFKYO."

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.340
A little acronym – a mantra, if you will.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.300
And it stands for, in short,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.780
"NO ONE FUCKING KNOWS YET, OKAY?!"

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.580
How long have we been wrong about almost everything?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.260
And look at what we got when we accepted we probably were –

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.520
black holes, quantum fields, time dilation, antibiotics,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.380
those umbrella hat things.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.560
We didn't kill magic, we just learned to use it properly and carefully,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.860
and it is very much alive and well in the form of the scientific method.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.380
And the pictures we have now of the world, subatomically and galactically,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.040
are more insane than ANY story we could have come up with.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.000
And even better – as far as we've tested, they're accurate!

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.060
THIS is the true age of magic!

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.580
Now! Right now!

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:57.320
We didn't get dragons, but you can take a big silver bird across the ocean if you want, and they'll serve you wine as you're fucking doing it!

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.320
And we got here by checking our intuitions against the world, and if they didn't work, we discarded them.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:08.620
And if they did work, we took the next step on the road to finding out what this fishbowl we're living in really is.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.080
All truth is one.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.140
In this light, may science and religion

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.380
endeavor together for the steady evolution of Mankind.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.020
From darkness to light,

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.960
from narrowness to broadmindedness,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.000
from prejudice to tolerance.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.680
It is the voice of life that calls to us to come and learn.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.760
Blessings of NOFKYOlogy upon you.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.460
Have a very merry Christmas,

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.680
and, if I may,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.960
a happy fucking New Year also.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.340
Bai.
