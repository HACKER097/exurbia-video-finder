00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
This is Viktor Frankl

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.899
He was a neurologist and a psychiatrist he lived through the concentration camps of the Second World War

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.580
He survived starvation slave labor watched countless people die

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.440
You know what the concentration camps were we went all on it.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.900
Anyway, during that time he had a revelation which was, this:

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.299
Humans are an animal driven by purpose, above all we strive for a sense of meaning in our lives

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
And if we don't get it we get extremely extremely sad and by the time I finished ranting at you today

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.220
I hope you will agree with this, too

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.119
For the longest time a good day for a human consisted of finding food, finding water, and not getting fucking eaten and even though

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.040
Hunter-gatherers probably have more free time than we do chances are the focus of their lives was to stay alive

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.520
Next, we developed a civilization and along came organized religion

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.240
I'm not shitting on religion here believe whatever you like, but whether the notorious

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.500
G.O.D does exist or not it arguably gave humans a purpose in the universe; we were special, we were loved

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040
(sometimes)

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.100
and we actually meant something in the grand scheme of things

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
Lately though things are getting a bit complicated

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.910
If you're listening to this there's a very strong chance you will never live through a war directly,

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.100
you will never experience prolonged starvation

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.260
or have to worry about getting access to clean drinking water

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.909
I say this not to guilt you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.840
But just to point out how much has changed for lots of us

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.800
however,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.780
whereas before the purpose of one's life was focused around not getting dead or

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.830
Remembering to worship the God of your choice today lots of us have more time to think about life

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.049
And we still don't have an agreed sense of what we're doing here

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.980
There is a shadow in the background of modern life. It is best described as having enough food,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.667
Hopefully having enough money to live on,

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:29.880
Not needing to worry about lions,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.700
And still being sure that some vital thing is missing

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.360
And that missing thing Viktor Frankl argued is meaning.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.760
Frankl noticed that lots of his patients had the sensation of total meaninglessness in their lives

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.037
He called this the existential vacuum

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:46.819
When I got my cap I asked the vet:

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.990
"What do cats need please?"

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.840
And she said: "food, water and fuzz."

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.040
I give her these things and she seems as far as I can tell pretty cool with the whole arrangement

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.720
At no point has she demanded to know the purpose of her existence or the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.520
It doesn't seem that easy to satisfy humans though, because we are very very clever animals (with some exceptions)

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.200
And oh look!

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.280
It's half-past-pop-psychology o'clock

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.260
Maybe you know about Maslow's hierarchy of needs it's not accepted by everyone, but it's a pretty good rough guide

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.520
So we're fairly sure humans need basic stuff first; food, water, sleep

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.160
Then security and safety and no getting numbed by lions, yes

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.474
Then belonging and love as in family intimate relations,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.200
Then self-esteem to be respected to be appreciated and then finally

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.380
Self-actualization or becoming that thing one actually wants to be.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.980
Lots of humans it seems, are somewhere between here and here

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.680
Hopefully lots of us are living in relative safety, and that's grand

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.740
But the general message of 21st century life for being self actualized at least in some parts of the world is

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.060
Make-de-moneyz or buy lots of property or something and then you'll miraculously be happy and fulfilled

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.957
Well, nothing wrong with money or houses,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.220
But it seems pretty evidential that is not enough for purpose and happiness in itself

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.080
A few recent studies hinted that having money does actually make you happier

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.240
Unless you win the lottery, interestingly

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.179
Then you're probably fucked, link below.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.480
But there does seem to be a limit

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.420
A Princeton study a while ago suggested that above about $75,000 dollars happiness and well-being doesn't increase that much

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.420
above a certain threshold of being able to support yourself and your family

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.460
Most humans don't get too much happier above that with money alone,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.709
So something else is required for happiness..

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.759
Happiness is one of the few things humans try to achieve for its own sake

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.319
But there's a problem with happiness

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.628
Which is the most of us seem to behave thinking well when I bought, finished, driven, built, completed X

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.809
I'll just be happy forever and nothing will ever hurt again

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.009
If you've ever tried being human you may have noticed that this is not how happiness works, ever

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.580
Usually over a long enough period of time humans revert back to their baseline hedonic setpoint their default happiness position

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.779
This is called the hedonic treadmill, and it's a fundamental shit part of the human condition

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.351
But what's interesting is that there doesn't seem to be a meaning treadmill in the same way

00:03:54.351 --> 00:04:00.240
For example: one of the most significant life events for lots of humans will be having more humans, eventually

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.349
And parenting itself seems to start off feeling pretty cool

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.849
But gets a bit fucking stressful for about 20 years and in those 20 years even though the euphoria dies off

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:12.700
And many parents at times wish to eat their young the feeling of purpose does not die off

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.740
This also appears to apply to long-term relationships that work,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.359
and professions people genuinely, actually, enjoy there may be difficult weeks or months

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.228
But overall if it's in line with what an individual actually wants, inherently

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:26.040
Then the thing continues to be meaningful for a long time

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.100
Possibly even for life.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.380
Meaning seems like a far more sustainable goal than happiness

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.320
And according to what we know so far, if you have the first, the second often follows

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.920
Even in hard times

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.060
Years ago I had a shit temp job in an office

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.040
And I spent the entire time being incompetent and fantasizing about getting out and my boss who was a nice lady

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.240
Seemed genuinely happy filling in spreadsheets and playing solitaire when the big boss wasn't looking and she was very clever

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.100
So one day I asked her why she liked working there,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.209
And she said that when she was little she used the dream about working in an office

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:00.130
and having a desk and going to the Coffee machine blah blah

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.810
and now she was living the dream

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.000
And I realized at that moment just how different humans' motivations can be.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.360
If working there was in line with what she wanted to do, and she was happy doing it,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.070
Which she was, then who the hell was I to tell her otherwise?

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.080
Unfortunately, humans are not cats and food and water and fuss just ain't gonna

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.229
Cut it most of us seem to want to be trying at something we enjoy

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.740
But the spectrum of human enjoyment is so vast

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.280
It's ridiculous, so there's not going to be some magical human science that says

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.440
"Alright you fucks, everyone eat five creme eggs a day, learn the accordion, get a job as a telephone sanitizer and then you'll find purpose in life"

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.560
It's something a lot more complicated than that

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.160
And Victor Frankl's position was that finding an individual sense of meaning is a journey the individual has to undertake alone

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.759
Sometimes you come across people who are much older than you, but a still self-centered or compulsive liars or whatever?

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.320
And it's worrying because you assumed if you just live long enough your work shed out and stuff will be fine

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.240
And here's someone who lived a long time and somehow is still an awful person

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.460
One day I was talking to a Buddhist nun about this,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.820
And she said "well obviously, you have to try it, being wise, or you'll spend your whole life never growing,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.800
Meaning is a jumper that you have to knit, yourself."

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.040
that seemed quite clever and quite true.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.080
Oh ey uh..

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.120
Jumper is a sweater to those of you living in certain breakaway British territories. What what?

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.580
Where we are now might be part of a huge experiment in human history

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.789
Which is give some people miraculous technology give them education

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.945
And mars bars and VR and see if that provides them with a purpose in life

00:06:27.945 --> 00:06:30.729
for some of them, lots of them, It doesn't seem to

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.360
The question then is "Yeah yeah, thanks for the technology and the education and everything,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.360
But life still feels empty on some level for some of us, and what the hell do we do now, please?"

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.617
Every age has its trials; the existential vacuum might be ours,

00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:46.930
If you take away the constant threat of death,

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.660
Purpose is given back to the individual and that's bad and that's good.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.999
if one actually pursues some individual sense of meaning whether it be in love or work or whatever

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.369
That's grant if not an entire lifetime can be spent and many have been spent doing nothing about it

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.690
The game of life begins with you appearing on the outskirts of this huge dark forest

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.060
You ask a few people what we're all doing here, but no one, including your parents or teachers really has a clue

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.160
Now you're told that inside the forest is real life

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.760
And if you go in you'll have to do battle with all sorts of monsters like: loneliness,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:21.240
Everything feeling futile, shit jobs, people being vindictive, your own limitations,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.300
Not knowing what you inherently want, worrying about income,

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.860
Worrying about disease, The death of people close to you,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.040
Universal human stuff, right?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.390
But facing up to it actually saying fuck you I'm gonna learn or make or become whatever it is

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.580
We'll just refuse to die on the inside despite living in a universe that is clearly not kind and where suffering is inevitable

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.179
That might be the only way of achieving some sense of individual meaning

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.811
What's that Ray Bradbury line?

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.500
Ask no guarantees, ask for no security

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.840
that never was such an animal and if there were, it would be related to the great sloth

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.990
Which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day sleeping its life away

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.667
Just being alive in the first place is fucking ridiculous,

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:58.840
And it's amazing that most of us are even keeping it together, at all

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.599
It's one thing to get called into creation without being asked first,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.279
It's an insult to injury to then be expected on top of that to work out what the hell you're doing here in the first (second) place

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:11.110
And I think there's a pretty good chance that Viktor Frankl and a bunch of others have already shown us how to beat that problem

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:17.530
Purpose seems to be personal, it comes from the inside from a sense of enjoying one's work from living around people one actually loves from

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:23.340
Striving to know even if only in a small human way for a short human time what we're even doing here in the first place

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.800
Individually,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.304
if not that then what the hell was the point in being here?

00:08:27.304 --> 00:08:28.940
And if that feels like a challenge,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.560
well that's to be expected because everyone else is playing the same game

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.460
Whether they admit it or not however much older however much more powerful they might be.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.080
What is it with these pricks one meets at parties sometimes who claims they've got it all worked out,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.800
Are you serious !?

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.440
Have you even noticed where you are!?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.059
You're finally just being called into creation are you?

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.732
You're all right with just popping down the shop for an ice-cream and pretending anything makes sense.

00:08:47.732 --> 00:08:48.740
Are you fucking kidding me!?

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.899
Oh, yeah, welcome to existence; everything is confusing, the universe is actively hostile,

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.420
And you don't even know what the conditions for your own happiness are,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.260
Oh, by the way, you're sentient meat standing on a living spaceship (!)

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.740
Best of luck coming to terms with that one,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.100
Yeah

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.156
Like getting very confused about all this isn't entirely natural for literally everyone

00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:06.580
Like we have anything more here than just each other,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.390
No one knows what they're doing

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.249
Everybody shits

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:09.879
and really,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.653
No one knows what they're doing

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.060
And that's alright.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.600
That's to be expected

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.922
Knit your own meaning jumper if you can, lots of other humans did

00:09:17.922 --> 00:09:19.659
And it seemed to work out for them

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.840
Cool,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.060
Rant over...

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.820
Good luck with your fucking lives then

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.720
oh

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.459
What's that? it's the Prince of milf, that book I wrote ages go out as a paperback finally

00:09:30.459 --> 00:09:32.320
You can get it on Amazon if you want

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.760
It's a story about what happens when the gods misbehave

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.200
Basically, it has a new cover a new introduction and you can actually hold it in your hands and shit

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.660
Baiiiiiii
