00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:05.608
Recently we've got pretty clever with telling stories like setting the plot out of time, setting the plot in space,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.680
Disregarding the plot entirely...

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.400
But I don't think much has changed about what we like in a story for all of our postmodern yada-yada.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.800
Stories basically still just come down to:

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
"Does characters what we like escape fron this ungood situation?

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.300
I hope they don't get murderized or nothing".

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.000
"Does characters what we like love each other and want to make out and stuff?"

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.529
"Is what we thought the story was the real story?

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.000
Or is there a twist with the robot man or a dubious soap salesman at some point."

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.900
And while that's all well and gravy I'm going to propose a little theory of everything,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.500
About why we like stories when we like them,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.700
And why we really don't, when we don't.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.500
And it's called Feelings, Pictures/Context and Ideas,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100
And it works like this:

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.900
If a movie or a book or whatever only cares about feelings

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.900
Then it's either really crap young adult fiction or daytime television.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.640
We get that the characters have emotions,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.509
We just don't really care because we don't understand where they are in their lives, or what's going on,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.900
And they don't propose anything new.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.700
If a movie or a book only cares about pictures or context, well, then you get a story

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000
that's obsessed with the weather, or the cinematography,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.200
Or what the moon looks like and everyone knows what the fucking moon looks like.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.800
If a movie or a book only cares about ideas that's great, but it's usually boring a shit,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.720
And you get unrelatable science fiction or art movies where people just vomit their opinions about things like no one does in real life... ever,

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.100
Except narcissistic pricks like, I don't know, youtubers... for example.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.200
But if you properly pickle that pineapple and you include all three, you get a Classic,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.000
when a writer or a director gets feelings, pictures and ideas working properly together,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.670
We can forgive basically everything else.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.900
I think that's why you can still watch "Citizen Kane" or "Twelve Angry Men"

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.100
Or even "Moby Dick", or "Shakespeare" decades or centuries later, and they're still brilliant.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.540
They're addressing feelings we have today, about death, or love, or whales, or cry-baby Danish princes.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.100
They're using interesting contexts like huge castles or the ocean,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.409
And they're throwing us ideas we don't think about that much on a daily basis:

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.409
"Should you be or not be?"

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.239
"What's the big deal with movies Willy anyway?"

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.219
Further example... Everyone bangs on about the Empire Strikes Back being a superior Star Wars movie blah blah,

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.109
And that's probably because it definitely is, but if we apply the old feelings, pictures, and ideas model to it,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200
I think it's pretty clear why it was indeed amazing.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.000
Well, there's certainly feelings: Everyone's in a pinch, everything shit, Darth Vader wants everyone dead.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.600
There's interesting pictures: There's the pretty snowy bits, and a spacey bits, and the cloudy bits.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.600
And there are lots of ideas: About loyalty, and sacrifice, and making out with members of your own family.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.300
To be even simpler about this, stories just have to be about someone we understand,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.000
Set somewhere vaguely interesting, and propose something,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.500
Anything even remotely new that we haven't thought about too much before.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.800
They are also required to make sense. The main character can then be a robot,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.000
or a drug-addled horse or a personified teddy bear...

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.700
Haha, what a story, Mark.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.500
For more popular examples of feelings, pictures, and ideas done perfectly,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.300
There is the "Blink" episode of "Doctor Who" with all the terrifying garden features,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.800
The entire first season of "Mindhunter", the Christmas episode of "Black Mirror",

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.779
"The Great Gatsby", "Cloud Atlas" (The book, that is.), "Catch-22", "To Kill a Mockingbird",

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.930
Original fucking "Bioshock" and "Wild Tales".

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.100
That's us, the storytelling ape. Sure we stopped pooping in the woods and huffing volcano vapor...

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.779
Well, maybe you did, but not too much has changed with human hardware, with the brain.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.399
We still seem to be telling basically the same stories our ancestors enjoyed, and most of them center around

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.589
Romance, power and Chelsea robot people. Primal stuff... Right?... Yeah, okay.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.100
Why? Because this is our condition, still, balancing between being animals and gods.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.200
We care about base stuff, but we want a bit of clever extend, too.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200
We evolved in tribes, we love gossip and the feelies.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.049
We evolved in nature, we liked scenery and context.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.139
We also evolved the Lamborghini of brain areas, the Neocortex.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.029
So we seem to be really into ideas like ethics, and politics, and putting watches up your bottom.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.850
We're designed to feel stuff, see stuff, and think stuff.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.500
Stories seem to work when they mimic those basic needs, and more than that,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.700
Telling stories is a fundamental human activity, I reckon.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.650
And if you needed to kick up the arse to make your own stuff, I will attempt to provide it... now.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.700
I doubt you know much about who your great-great-great grandparents were.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.738
I certainly don't know anything about mine, and truth be told it's very unlikely that your

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.348
Great-great-great grandchildren will know much about you.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.700
But one day our distant descendants will probably get curious about who we were and what we thought about the world,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.600
And they'll look back at the stories we're telling now.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.659
To our literature, and our movies, and our video games, and our TV, and everything else.

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.200
That's how we build time capsules. Now to be clear, I'm not saying all our media is great,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.600
But Hot Diggity we're making some good stuff at the moment,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.200
And Hot Diggity I'm sure lots of it will survive for a long time after we're gone.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.100
And the cool thing is that there's really not much stopping any of us from making our own stuff,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.940
In one form or another. Not necessarily to be immortalized,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.380
But just to have set a true thing about where we are now, because the world won't look like this forever,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.380
And we won't be here forever.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.500
Humans are transient, stories are eternal, or as eternal as will be getting anytime soon.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.500
It's a little nod to future generations.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.100
Hey, we were here. We felt stuff. We saw stuff. We thought stuff.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.880
Love and kisses in the 21st century. And we also saw the first launch of the Falcon Heavy so fuck you.

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.959
It's debatable whether cryogenics or mind uploading will take off in our lifetimes,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.720
We're probably not going to be the first immortal generation.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.630
But if you can say a true thing about how we feel about the world right now,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.000
And what it looks like and what we think about it, there is every chance that that will stick around.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.900
Happy making things, mother lovers.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.900
All the best.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.700
Ciao.
