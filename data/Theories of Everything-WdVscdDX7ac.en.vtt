00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.559
There's still a holy grail that scientists are searching for and it's called a theory of everything.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.140
What is a theory of everything? Well...

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.220
This is General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory. Both are good descriptions of the universe

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.180
but they don't match up. Which is weird because they both describe the same universe.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.120
Or if you put them together you get a message from the universe to physicists trying to understand it:

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.880
''God Recommends You Quit Fucking Trying''

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.220
General Relativity is the brainchild of Einstein, the king of science himself, and more or less says that gravity is

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.460
a geometric property of space and time. Meaning space and time can also be distorted. For more information see black holes, high speeds, and pot brownies.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.800
Quantum Field Theory on the other hand, describes the very little world of the subatomic and says that particles are what you get when you excite fields.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.770
Humans like describing complex phenomena with models.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.839
We did it with economics and computer science

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.020
and the British political system...

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.460
The Dream™, is to finally do it in physics with relativity and quantum mechanics

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.580
and get them to take their clothes off together and get their freak on. This would revolutionize science.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.440
However there are some serious compatibility issues and lots of the problems come from the Standard Model.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.980
Last week we touched on the Standard Model

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.199
Which is a pretty nifty description of how matter works.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.420
But there is still some outstanding homework to be done by humanity.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.560
Firstly: Symmetry. Normally nature is a pretty classy girl

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.769
but in this case she's gone all loosey-goosey. Almost everything in nature is

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.412
symmetrical when we look deeply enough into her( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:01:16.412 --> 00:01:17.160
or ''it'', rather.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.880
This can be seen from honeycombs, to galaxies to the first very good seasons of Dexter to the *other ones*

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.220
However physics is currently not very symmetrical and we don't know why.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.479
Problem ''deux'':  Dark matter.  The universe is behaving a bit oddly at the moment and while

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.438
it seems overweight when it gets on the scales, we can't seem to find all that extra mass anywhere.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.880
This is where dark matter comes in which is an invisible mystery ingredient, that the Standard Model currently can't explain.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.159
Thirdly: Gravity - we all know it exists.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.760
(Especially my ex-girlfriend)

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.520
(HORROR SCREAM)

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.240
*crash*

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.160
But the Standard Model currently takes the approach of ''Lalalalalala gravitons maybe, don't want to talk about it. Oh look. A kestrel''

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.860
(BIRD SQUAWKS)

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.740
What we need, is a theory of everything that explains gravity and dark matter and reunites relativity with quantum mechanics and does a little

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.780
backflip for a cheeky encore. Here are some delicious theory of everything recipes that scientists have tried so far.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.080
Recipe one: String theory cake. To bake a string theory cake you will need:

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.360
Several kilograms of scientific optimism, a jar of hidden spatial dimensions and a sprinkle of supersymmetry. The basic idea is this:

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.129
Just like the strings of a violin can play lots of different notes

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.000
particles may be made of common objects, called ''strings''. If they vibrate at different frequencies they create different particles.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.340
(VIOLIN PLAYS NOTES)

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.600
One of them may even be a graviton, finally explaining what gravity actually is.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.860
(EXCITED VIOLIN)

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.640
However, string theory wasn't happy with the usual missionary position, of three dimensions of space and one dimension of time that we're used to.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.420
No - In some versions she needs 26 dimensions to make the maths work.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.420
Anything else we can get for you String Theory, cup of tea, massage, fucking private jet, you insufferable diva??

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.420
Recipe number two: Loop quantum gravity cake. Combine a little self raising flour with the tears of Michio Kaku and voilá!

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.960
Loop quantum gravity is string theory's slightly more awkward, but still very clever, main competitor.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.720
If gravity really is a property of space-time, like some scientists believe it is

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800
*ahem-hem*

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.560
Instead space might be made of loops forming something called a ''spin foam''. And even though it doesn't explain everything yet

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.820
it does kind of explain gravity. So. You know. That's all right, isn't it?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.220
Recipe three: Miscellaneous. There are plenty of other theories of everything such as:

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.480
Causal Dynamical Triangulation, which divides space-time into dinky little triangles and solves a number of problems that way.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.820
Or Modified Newtonian Dynamics, which tries to explain dark matter away, by sitting Isaac Newton down and giving him a stern talking-to.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.100
Or the E8 Model, which is very pretty geometric explanation for how all particles interact with each other.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.600
And finally, Recipe number four: Shut up, no cake for you. Also known as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.460
Mathematician Kurt Gödel decided to give everyone the finger in 1931, by pointing out that no system of mathematics is self contained.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.420
Or, to put it another way, if you have any arithmetic in a system

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.019
there'll be things you can never ever prove for certain. That might mean, according to Gödel, that we can

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.820
have a true theory of everything, so thanks for that.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.920
Dick.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.940
Anyway, these are all fun ideas.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.560
But maybe none of them are correct and the real answer will turn up unexpectedly one day.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.640
With very little warning. At a totally inappropriate moment without our permission.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.200
Much like a certain Windows update, Microsoft, you bunch of total cun-
