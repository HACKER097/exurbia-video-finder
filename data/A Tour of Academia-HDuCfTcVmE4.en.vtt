00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
Oh hi.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.210
Welcome to Academia.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.890
Let's take a quick look around.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.740
One of oldest and most famous cities in Academia
is called philosophy.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.339
Most of the people there spend their time
writing papers, going to conferences, or ending

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.339
up as baristas.

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.079
That was a joke obviously.

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.139
No one in philosophy gets invited to conferences.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.010
Now, if you head east across unemployable
mountain, you eventually get to Physics and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.060
Math.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.420
Now you probably want to visit these if you're
interested in numbers, precision, and a lifetime of

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.900
sexual abstinence.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.720
Both have their own neighbourhoods, of course.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.180
I'd recommend the quantum district but just
be aware they've got a bit of a thing for

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.469
murdering cats, whatever that's all about.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.210
Maths has its own weird parts of town, P and
NP who are kind of at war at the moment.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.679
There's also Geometry Island which is basically
just lines.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.100
Several hours dive away is astronomy, but
I'd give it a miss.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.879
Bit of a black hole if you know what I mean.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.969
Engineering is quite nice, but they haven't
really contributed much recently though to

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.221
be honest, just.. bridges, dams, turbines.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.270
Oh and planes obvously.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.379
And rockets.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.120
And space stations, petroleum,,
motors, telecommunications, electronics,,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.140
and the industrial
revolution.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.360
Let's be honest, bunch of lazy pricks.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.180
If you have a bit of extra time, just over
Humanities River is literature, take a walk

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.890
round the Russian neighbourhoods, their police
department is excellent, everyone's obsessed

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.000
with Crime and Punishment.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.500
The American district is all right too, the
weather's pretty brutal during the day but

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.250
Tender is the Night, and the British section
isn't bad but just don't go in with any great

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.590
expectations, eh?

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.950
Just a few miles east is History.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.940
Now they're good people, but they do seem
to hang onto the past a bit.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.340
Jesus just let it go guys, all right.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.730
Linguistics is currently off limits at the
moment with an outbreak of irritable vowel

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.730
syndrome.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.300
But West Chomsky is very nice, lovely gnomes.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.960
A few miles away there's the gender studies waterfall.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.170
They're usually quite pushy about everyone
checking their sunscreen.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.250
And their privilege.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.700
Just over Sarkeesian canyon we find education

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.290
I'd be very careful about visiting unless
you're a fan of  incompetant idiot midgets.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.850
I believe they're commonly referred to as
children.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.380
Psychology is an up and coming city, I'd recommend
the Odeipus Rex district which is full of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.560
milfs, Skinner Island, but just be sure to
watch your behaviour, and the Milgram quarter,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.690
but I'd avoid that one unless you want quite a
shock.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.490
And then there's there's sociology where everyone
is so advanced that that they've stopped believing in

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.130
stupid old fashioned
concepts like “proof”

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.990
Anthropology which is full of stalkers,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.260
Theology, but Jesus Christ, those guys work
religiously,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Economics.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.620
There's supposedly treasure buried somewhere.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.620
I don't know.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.830
I guess X Marx the spot

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.200
Medicine, where the local pastime is being
sued for trying to help people

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.700
Communication studies is a nice little break,
be sure to give it your full attention and have

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.700
a proper gander.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.700
Law is lovely.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.390
You can take a left at smallprint avenue,
a right onto litigation street, straight up

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.420
matrimonial highway and yeah, by the time
you reach the fountain you'll find yourself

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.340
bankcrupt and paying for your ex's lawyer.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.300
Back over unemployable mountain, just past
film studies I'd advise finishing off your

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.780
trip with a visit to the Performing Arts,
where the inhabitants are lovely, by my god

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.540
do they make a song and dance of everything.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.850
Now the geology of Academia is quite interesting.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.620
There are undergraduates at the top,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.780
Then a sub layer of postgrads who have been
severely crushed by geological pressure.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.780
And life,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.610
And finally the PHDs and staff who exist in
a constant state of stress and have been turned

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.930
into human magma.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.930
You'll know you've reached this level when
you notice something wet and soggy draining

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.910
out of your ear one day and realise it's your
soul.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.630
So if all that sounds up your street, why
not visit academia yourself?

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.400
I only came to avoid getting a real job and
I've been trapped here for 9 years.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400
Did I say trapped?

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.740
I meant, having a lovely time.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.569
It's like prison but the
sex isn't as regular.
