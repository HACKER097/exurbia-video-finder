00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
All the blood vessels in your body laid end to end

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.680
would reach about 60,000 miles, wrapping around the Earth at least twice and

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.900
-WOAH! Slow down.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.020
Jesus Christ, you haven't even been born yet.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.300
Let's begin in the beginning, huh? Come on, back we go.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.860
Past through your childhood rubbish - try not to freak out.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.820
But you're about to be conceived. Okay?

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.520
Don't worry. It won't last long.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.900
Pause for suspense and...

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.260
Ah, there it is!

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.360
Out of roughly 100 million sperm, one gets through and fertilizes an egg of your mother's, creating a zygote.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.400
And congratulations!

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.880
That was probably the most remarkable thing you will ever do.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.380
Within about a day, the egg

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.200
or blastocyst

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.700
or

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.260
life wrecker

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.560
starts dividing like crazy and attaches itself to the inside of the womb called the endometrium.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.380
Give it about three weeks and the little sucker already has nerve cells.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.340
By about month two, you have little grabby bits,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.100
walky bits,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.720
and you already sort of resemble a human at about an inch long and a thirtieth of an ounce.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.440
Good job.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.280
By about month five, your muscles are fairly developed

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.860
and you might start jiggling about in a medical process known as womb raving.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.960
By month seven, your hearing is working and you're about 14 inches long.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.100
And by month nine, hopefully all systems are online.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:59.120
Vision

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.770
☑ Vision

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.300
Movement

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.820
☑ Movement

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.790
A general sense that you know better than your parents for the next 25 years despite total ignorance on literally all matters:

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:06.620
Shee-ya,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.480
☑ ☑

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.540
And you're done cooking.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.860
And much to the world's horror, you were born.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.860
Welcome to life.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.840
Get lots of sunlight.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.260
Don't eat the yellow snow.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.200
Off you go then.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.920
Good luck.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.820
You'll fucking need it.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.240
And gosh is your body clever.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.560
You're probably made of at least 30 trillion cells which come in about 200 flavors.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.960
For example:

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.020
White Blood Cells

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.700
Neurons

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.340
Fat Cells

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.180
Red Blood Cells

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.900
Somatotropes

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.720
Lactotropes

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.560
Thyrotropes

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.320
TV Tropes

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.960
Merkel Cell

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.720
Helper T Cells

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.640
Suppressor T Cells

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.440
Model T Cells

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.520
Unipolar Brush Cells

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.820
Relative and Absolute Cells

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.440
and Gametes.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.780
And then there is spermatozoon which is only included because when I discovered the word about a week ago,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.600
I almost dirtied my undergarments.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240
Spermatozoon.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.160
Sometimes cells collect into organs directed by DNA.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.320
Organs form systems.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.680
There are about 10 systems going on all at once in your body.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.720
Nasty stuff first,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.799
there's the renal system,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.240
which is made up of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.600
Except me because I have no obvious function in the body getting infected and killing you.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.740
The kidneys filter blood of nasties which can then be expelled from your body and left on the toilet seat

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.500
for the next poor person at the bar to come in

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.900
and find and get blamed for if he doesn't clean it up.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.340
Prick.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.060
There's the cardiovascular/circulatory system which gets blood from A to B and back again.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.300
What is blood exactly?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.540
Well I'm glad you asked.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.920
Red and complicated.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.420
It isn't ever blue when it's in your veins by the way.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.160
That's bollocks.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.630
One regular passenger on the blood underground is oxygen.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.860
The lungs absorb oxygen down through the bronchioles into about 300 million alveoli and then into the blood.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.120
Your heart keeps the blood flowing about 1,800 gallons of the stuff every day

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.780
and supply cells with oxygen which is basically how they release energy and do their thing.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.140
However, your cells also need foods.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.920
Digestion begins in the mouth with saliva, which is full of an enzyme called amylase.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.060
It then takes a little trip in the stomach where it's dissolved by more enzymes,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.180
namely pepsin.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.400
The first recorded removal of an appendix was in 1735 by the name of

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.300
Enzymes are the cocaine of digestion, they speed things up.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.420
Then food is attacked by acids which break it down mostly into glucose.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.760
It moves into the intestines which you have about 25 feet, or 7 meters of and passes into the blood.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.140
Your pancreas releases insulin accordingly

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.960
which tells your cells to stop mucking about and actually absorb the glucose, and you know, like,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.760
keep you alive

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.400
and shit

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.020
Please?

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.520
Which it does and if you're watching this, then congratulations.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.200
You in fact,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.140
still alive.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.820
And that's also thanks to vitamins.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.420
Vitamins are essential for humaning, but your body is crap at producing them.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.020
Take vitamin C for example.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.100
For some reason humans can't produce it themselves.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.400
And when you don't get enough, you get other stuff instead.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.220
Like scurvy

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.920
or dead

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.100
or most likely both.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.120
Vitamin B1 is also weird.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.640
You only need roughly an ounce spread across your lifetime,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.140
which is about 28 grams or as I like to call it

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.000
a fun evening in.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.250
28 grams is nothing over 80 years.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.150
But if you don't get it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.420
you'll be rewarded with a number of achievements including

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.400
chronic fatigue,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.480
heart complications,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.380
and psychosis.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.440
Lovely!

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.660
Then there is the endocrine system

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.460
Not to be confused with the exocrine

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.560
or Endor system.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.920
This produces hormones. Hormones tell your body to do pretty much everything

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.180
from sleep to sexy times

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.860
and imbalances can make you a seriously sad panda.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.660
Then there's the integumentary system which is basically skin and protected tissue.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.180
Skin is an organ too by the way.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.040
The muscular/skeletal system, fairly self-explanatory.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.140
Well, not really.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.080
There just aren't that many orthopedic jokes to be quite honest with you.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.140
There's the reproductive system

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.600
which is in between your legs and for making the babies.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.440
And oh, what's that?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.060
It's a sternly worded email from YouTube insisting if I talk about dicks again,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.000
I won't have a channel. So moving on.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.300
There's the respiratory system

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.460
which we kind of covered.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.180
Oxygen in, carbon dioxide out.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.980
The lymphatic system carries a fluid around your body called lymph

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.740
-PHHHHHHHHHHH…

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.380
PHHHHH.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.340
Which mainly contains white blood cells and fights infections such as flu, mononucleosis,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.120
and greyscale.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.220
Finally there's the nervous system which is a bit like the internet of your body,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.180
but without the porn.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.460
It's composed of your central nervous system which is your brain and spinal column

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.020
and the peripheral nervous systems which carries the signals in between

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.520
and gets about as much credit as the drummer of Muse, even though they're both essential for hysteria.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.160
However, that in turn is made up of firstly the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
which takes care of business when everything's chill,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.620
and the sympathetic nervous system, which floods the blood with adrenaline when shit's going down.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.340
Or when you happen to find yourself flying Wizz Air sober.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.600
Anyway... other notable mentions include

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.340
- as well as breaking down fats and keeping blood sugar stable.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.060
Then there's Charles de Gall Bladder who 
stores bile from the liver.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.520
Antibodies or immunoglobulin are pretty clever.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.960
They're produced by white blood cells and they fight off bacteria and viruses.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.000
There are five main types:

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.760
IgM

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.380
IgG

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.960
IgA

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.460
IgD

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.760
and IgE.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.860
And gosh your brain is clever.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.980
No really it is.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.240
100 billion neurons

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.700
and 100 trillion synapses,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.980
all connections between them.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.340
Just for a bit of perspective,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.420
a billion seconds is 31 years,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.100
a trillion seconds is about 31,000 years.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.900
So that's quite a few synapses. Yeah.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.220
Lots of interesting spots:

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.260
the visual cortex,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.440
the auditory cortex,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.180
and this bit, the prefrontal cortex

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.380
among other things

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.460
regulates you not being a fucking idiot.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.580
And impulse control.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.040
And it only properly matures in most adults around age 25.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.420
Probably explaining a number of your questionable life decisions prior to that.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.440
Anything afterwards, I'm afraid you are probably just being a bellend.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.940
There's also the consciousness cortex

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.940
explaining where sentience comes from

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.560
NOT

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.360
but all the same,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.440
in a way we're not even close to explaining yet;

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.280
all these cells and electrical impulses somehow come together to create a unified sense of you.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.300
And if I may say so,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.100
what a lovely job they're doing so far.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.820
So that's your body, sort of.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.500
Not really.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.160
But sort of.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.260
Cheers evolution!

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.900
Could do with a bit of bug fixing though.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.120
For version 2, can we please get rid of hiccups,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.620
uh...

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.340
morning breath,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.180
throwing up a bit in your own mouth,

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.160
sharting,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.200
and untimely erections at funerals.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.180
That'd be great.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.280
Still, not a bad piece of engineering. Lots of systems running parallel, maintained by cell regeneration,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.240
trying to trick you into making babies until it all goes wrong somewhere down the line,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.660
ending in oblivion.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.660
So in the meantime,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.220
How about go for a walk or something?

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.020
Buy a boat,

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.040
do a handstand,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.140
smell the roses.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.320
Actually yeah, we forgot about that one.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.760
The nose is really quite complicated

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.500
and it's an extremely important appendage compared to

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.320
No I...

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.340
I said appendage...

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.960
like...

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.960
Oh fuck.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.680
I'm so tired of your shit.
