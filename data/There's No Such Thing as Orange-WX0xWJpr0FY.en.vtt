00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.960
what a miracle life is how lucky we are

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.839
to exist on this planet if even for a

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.279
short time

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.880
and i'll tell you what makes me feel

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.320
better about wasting that time and

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200
probably dying alone

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.080
regularly consuming gigantic quantities

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.440
of

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.199
chocolate yes delicious eh but how does

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.119
chocolate end up in your terribly clever

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.800
brain as the taste of chocolate

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.880
well your tongue and your schnoz of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.880
course your tongue is covered in several

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.800
thousand taste buds made up of about 50

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.320
gustatory receptor cells each

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.239
it's fairly accepted there are five

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.760
building blocks of taste sweet

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.000
sour salty bitter and umami umami

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.840
is basically the taste of savory stuff

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.440
green tea and shiitake mushrooms are

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.559
good examples if you're curious

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.320
that thing about different tongue

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.280
sections tasting different flavors isn't

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.200
true by the way but

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.440
heiho now for taste you'll need your

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.520
nose too your nose is full of cells

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.160
called olfactory sensory neurons quite

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.920
high up

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.840
different smells play these cells like

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.680
molecular keys on a piano

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.039
anyway the information about the taste

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.879
and smell of the chocolate from your

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.640
excellent beak and mouth waggler get

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.720
transmitted electrically to your brain

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.560
specifically the gustatory and olfactory

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.080
cortex and that's a great olfactory

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.159
cortex you have there by the way

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.240
and that information ends up somehow

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.040
turning into the perception of the taste

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.600
of chocolate

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.119
easy right okay but you don't see

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.479
chemical information about chocolate

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.200
scrolling across your eyes like the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.600
terminator

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.880
you experience it as a sensation and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.960
that is the rub

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.000
because we don't know yet how mata how

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.920
chemistry how sugar

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.840
and cocoa end up going from electrical

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.479
signals in your brain to the taste of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.880
chocolate

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.400
the experience of chocolate in your mind

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.200
this is called the hard problem of

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.720
consciousness

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.240
and if you don't mind i would like to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.360
convince you today that it is the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.520
greatest mystery

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.079
in history the sensations of experience

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.799
are called

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.960
qualia qualia are the feels of something

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.600
how an experience tastes or looks or

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.320
sounds

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.920
take a sunset if you will in reality all

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.360
we're really seeing is wavelengths of

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.759
the electromagnetic spectrum

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.360
in this case around 600 nanometers if

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.360
we're being fancy schmancy

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.280
but your eyes turn those wavelengths

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.159
into information and your brain turns

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.280
that information

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.200
into yellow and orange into experience

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.800
and the colors themselves as you see

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.200
them are the qualia

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.480
the orangeness of orange it's the same

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.560
with the hotness of heat

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.319
the sweetness of chocolate the nausea of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.400
a tummy ache the elements of

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.000
experience imagine you were talking to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.760
someone who can't see color

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.760
how would you describe the color orange

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.680
to them now you might say

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.760
it's like red but with more yellow in it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.440
but that's not gonna work silly

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.800
they don't know what the experiences of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
red and yellow are

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.879
have you ever chomped on some asparagus

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.319
then gone to pee a little while later

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.599
and almost passed out from the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.200
disgusting smell

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.959
if you haven't that's because you don't

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.560
have the gene or genes to detect

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.800
asparagus metabolites

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.000
and you are one lucky papa because the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.560
smell is [ __ ]

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.599
vile as far as we know only about half

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.519
the world population

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.440
are lucky enough to have the genetics to

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.280
detect it the funny thing is

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.560
if you don't have the genetics you'll

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.319
never know what it's like

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.560
you could train as a scientist and

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.239
specialize in the asparagus piss effect

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.280
and become the world's leading authority

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.280
on it bit weird

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.040
but you do you you could know everything

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.560
academically there was to know about the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.720
asparagus piss effect

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.440
everything accepts the disgusting smell

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.920
itself everything except the qualia

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.519
and the qualia are everything if you've

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.200
never seen a certain color if you've

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.720
never tasted a particular flavor

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.959
hell if you've never been in love you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.560
can read 10 000 eloquent descriptions of

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.360
whatever but that will never be the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.599
qualia

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.879
description and experience live in two

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.879
separate universes

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.879
in reality of course there is no such

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.879
thing as asparagus piss or the color

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.480
orange or the sound of a kettle boiling

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.000
or the coldness of snow

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.680
and if somehow we could experience

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.920
objective reality directly

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.760
whatever that [ __ ] means all you

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.400
would find in the real world outside of

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.640
our heads

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.680
is chemical compounds and wavelengths of

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.840
em radiation

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.519
and vibrations in the air and relatively

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.000
less energetic atoms

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.239
there is no orange it is just one of the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.640
many millions of veils our brains drape

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.799
over reality to understand reality

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.400
and if the brain is an electrochemical

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.200
computer if it's just

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.159
meat how does it turn electricity into

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.000
experience

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.200
into the sweetness of chocolate into the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.680
orange of a sunset

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.040
or from asparagus into the fine bouquet

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.440
of satan's taint

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.720
the hard problem of consciousness how

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.800
does the brain create

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.240
qualia now there are the so-called easy

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.320
problems of consciousness

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.080
stuff like how is it that you that is

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.759
your brain can shift your focus of

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.080
attention between stuff

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.680
or how do you categorize information

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.600
these are a bit like the problem of how

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.040
we'll get humans to mars or something

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.120
they're tricky problems but they're

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.680
technically feasible with enough cocaine

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.520
coffee

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.520
scientists will probably crack them one

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.040
day the reason why the hard problem of

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.320
consciousness is often considered the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.560
big boy of questions

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.320
the hard problem is because as it stands

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.320
today we don't even have the beginning

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.720
of the beginning of a sensible answer to

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.600
it

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.600
how does this turn this into this how

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.000
does electricity get transformed into

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.240
colors and sounds and experience

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.160
and as much as us clever 21st century

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.800
carbon units know about the furniture of

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.639
reality

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.240
about the curvature of space-time and

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.440
the unpalatable presentation of a

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.759
baboon's arse

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.520
nothing yet in our now vast libraries of

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.000
the qualities of the natural world

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.800
have much to say about how meat makes a

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.320
mind

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.919
despite the fact that we're made up of

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.720
elements you'll find everywhere else in

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.639
the universe

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.880
hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.479
accounting for 99 of our bodies

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.400
something about the way those elements

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.919
are put together turns into something

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.639
that knows it's made of matter in the

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.800
first place

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.560
and has experiences we're made of

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.199
universe but we actually know we're

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.160
universe

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.120
we are food that can enjoy food and yet

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.440
the hard problem

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.400
remains now what we're getting very good

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.000
at doing recently

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.680
is finding correlations between what

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.840
your brain and body is doing

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.960
physical you and what your mind is doing

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.120
at the same time

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.880
the wibbly consciousness [ __ ] we know

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.400
that the hormone cortisol correlates

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.160
very closely with anxiety

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.680
we know that an altered gamma brainwave

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.759
pattern correlates very closely with

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.919
epilepsy and several mood disorders

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.840
or vice versa we know if you're enjoying

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.680
downton abbey erotic fan fiction

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.600
you'll probably be using your cerebrum

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.840
for processing the text and so on

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.199
we have a huge map of what brain area

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.680
and biological process

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.440
correlates with which mental state but

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.360
that doesn't tell us what the mechanisms

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.120
of qualia and consciousness are yet

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.280
any more than if you asked how voting

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.880
works in the uk and someone just showed

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.520
you a picture of number 10 downing

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.479
street

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.160
that's where that's not how incidentally

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.720
that little feline outside is called

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.479
larry

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.319
he is the current chief mouser to the

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.880
cabinet office that's not me being

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.560
quirky

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.560
it's true and he's a very good boy

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.400
alright the brain is a huge

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.600
unbelievably complicated network of

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.520
inputs and outputs

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.360
it can do graphics and audio and

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.680
parallel processing and storage

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.720
the thing is clearly a computer of sorts

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.560
but computation

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.240
can't be the end of the story because

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.440
computers are great at manipulating

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.360
information like us

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.039
but as far as we know computers don't

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.759
experience information like

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.120
us something is in this gap turning meat

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.360
into experiences

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.039
if indeed we are just meat there are a

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.919
million theories as to what that process

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.680
is of course

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.680
maybe consciousness is a fundamental

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.759
property of matter distributed across

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.400
the entire universe and brains focus it

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.759
somehow

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.120
maybe it's just what happens when you

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.840
integrate enough information in the

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.000
right way

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.120
or maybe it's a fancy illusion and what

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.639
it feels like to be you

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.479
is just the side quest your brain is

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.840
playing after it's already decided what

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.400
it's going to do anyway

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.560
but one thing is for sure every proposal

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.360
we have so far for qualia generation and

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.360
consciousness

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.120
requires the kind of explosive leap one

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.120
only experiences the morning after

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.280
eating california reaper peppers

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.280
elaborate as they are every explanation

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.199
so far is a physical description of

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.039
matter but what we want to know is how

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.039
mata becomes experience

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.639
we must propel ourselves off the toilet

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:46.879
of the brain mind correlation

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.759
towards the imodium of a final theory of

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:49.520
consciousness

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.440
we must collapse the duality of the

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.080
subjective and objective worlds

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.560
once and for all and talking of which

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.879
gosh

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.440
humans love dualities don't we good

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:00.639
versus evil wads of paper versus le

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.919
washi bumble

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:06.000
mind versus body

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:07.440
the mind body problem is about as angry

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.120
as you can make a philosopher

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.120
how can we explain what it's like to be

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.000
a mind if minds are made out of

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.720
universally dead

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.479
stuff so in a condescending pattern head

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.360
fashion the battle boils down to

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:19.680
materialism

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.440
versus non-materialism firstly the

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.520
argument from materialism then

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.360
materialism is basically the idea that

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.000
everything in the universe from galaxies

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.639
to the weather

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to little hourly wows spring from

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:32.479
physics from mata

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.440
from quantum fields not wibbly extra

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:35.039
physical stuff

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.039
the heart is a machine there's no

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.599
wizards in your spleen as weird as it

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.519
may be

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:42.000
why can't consciousness be a biological

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:43.919
process like digestion or cell division

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.360
humans have a bit of a tendency for

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.440
claiming stuff we don't understand

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.279
is supernatural well it turns out the

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.040
sun isn't pulled up by a chariot

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:52.560
germ theory was a lot more of a powerful

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.200
explanation for disease than getting

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.440
cursed

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.800
yes consciousness is super weird it's

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.560
unlike any other phenomenon we've

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.240
discovered so far and we are in quite

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.080
the pickle trying to explain it

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.000
but we've been in pickles before the

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.800
origin of species the formation of

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.560
galaxies

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.320
the answer is almost impossible to

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.279
imagine until someone explains it

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.720
scientifically

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:12.320
and then it's so obvious we can't

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.920
believe we didn't get it earlier

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.839
give science and philosophy some time

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.120
with consciousness we've done it before

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:21.040
we'll [ __ ] do it again then there is

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.000
the non-materialist response to that and

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.040
it sometimes goes

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.720
a little like this yes

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.160
science has been super powerful in

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.080
explaining the world around us

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.000
but hang on there dick pump everything

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.080
explained so far has been dead stuff

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.320
you can explain stars mechanistically

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.080
because they are mechanistic how

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.680
using our current picture of matter are

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.720
you going to jump from interactions and

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.880
physical qualities

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.680
to matter that knows its matter that

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.360
feels like a mind that has experiences

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.120
this isn't a gap because we don't have a

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.200
materialist theory yet it's a gap

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.640
because materialism can't account for it

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.240
even if you had a perfect map of

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.680
correlations between what the brain is

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.240
doing and how the person with the brain

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.839
feels

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.399
even if you had a special recipe that

00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:02.079
goes take some neural oscillations

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:04.160
add in x amount of integrated

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:05.200
information sprinkle in some quantum

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.440
coherency

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.959
do a [ __ ] backflip and then brains

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.800
will be conscious

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:12.800
isn't that still just a description

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.880
rather than an explanation again

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.079
anyway that's a pretty [ __ ] caricature

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.920
of the materialist versus

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:18.560
non-materialist debate as it stands

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.399
today

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.320
if i've mischaracterized your position

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:23.279
please accept this vintage depiction of

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.600
a pomeranian

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:27.279
i hope we can still be friends and on

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.800
top of that you might reasonably wonder

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:30.320
why anyone should even give a [ __ ] about

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.640
the hard problem of consciousness

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.800
or how consciousness arises anyway we

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.560
are conscious we can see sunsets

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:42.480
shut up but to that i would reply no

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.120
you yes we might be far off cracking

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.519
this thing

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.279
but if we crack it if we finally set up

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:49.040
a sturdy bridge between descriptions of

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:50.640
physical states and mental states

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.240
if we have a working theory of the

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.200
relationship between the brain and the

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.720
conscious mind

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.800
it won't just herald in a shower of

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.440
nobel prizes it will mean we can start

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.760
addressing

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.600
actual endgame meaning of life questions

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.519
we will have codified answers to the

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.560
existential quandaries dating back to

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:07.040
the ancients

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.279
like do we actually have free will and

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.720
is consciousness baked into matter or is

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:12.720
it an emergent phenomenon

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.160
and how do mothers turn food into

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.800
thinking conscious people in their

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.640
tummies

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.399
and could we one day make other stuff

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.480
conscious like machines or new

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:22.480
artificially organized states of matter

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.560
and how did evolution create conscious

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.200
animals anyway was it advantageous

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.519
somehow

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.680
and okay why was it how is it better

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:31.519
than just evolving biological robots

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.519
and for that matter how conscious are

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:35.519
our animal mates and just what

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:37.120
is a thought how are we thinking or

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.920
feeling for that matter how the hell are

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.600
we collecting

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.440
binding and experiencing sensory

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.000
information from the dead mathematical

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.600
world beyond

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.839
our minds and translating that into

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.360
chocolate and rakia and cold and rough

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:48.800
and misery and curiosity and

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.760
indifference and satisfaction and

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.880
ambivalence and

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:55.600
being just the feeling of being a being

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.560
what is qualia how is experience even

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.639
possible

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.639
why the [ __ ] is orange

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.320
i'm going out for the day and don't

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.320
smoke all my weed again

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.560
there's a weird feeling you get

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:15.760
sometimes if you're into all this

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.440
consciousness stuff

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.040
because you can get knee deep in the

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.720
isms and the mud slinging and

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.720
philosophers bullshitting each other

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.959
and you suddenly step back and think oh

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.519
my god this isn't some highfaluting

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:29.920
academic problem the mystery is in me

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:31.600
the mystery is me right now at the

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.839
center of our heads is the point of

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.480
contention of millennia of debate

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:37.200
conscious experience it is the greatest

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.519
mystery

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.600
and if the greatest mystery of all time

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:42.240
was hiding anywhere else but inside our

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.320
own heads

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.760
we'd never stop [ __ ] talking about it

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.160
but because it's so close

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.440
because it's us it barely gets mentioned

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.920
outside of academia

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.200
every sense coming in every color every

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.040
sound every taste

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.519
the mystery is yelling at us the whole

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.600
time how is experience possible

00:12:57.519 --> 00:13:00.639
how am i possible what is inside me

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.720
doing all of this

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:03.680
and maybe the same goes for mammals for

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.320
marine life

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.880
god knows who else a bunch of non-human

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.200
animals

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.440
seem to have internal lives of some kind

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.279
don't doggos go mental when we come home

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.079
because they're actually feeling happy

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:17.040
to see us

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:18.079
didn't the killer whale j35 carry her

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.399
dead daughter's body

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:21.839
for a thousand miles refusing to let her

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:24.399
fall to the ocean floor

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:25.120
not out of some robotic inbuilt reflex

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:27.680
but because

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.720
she was sad because she was grieving

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.800
beyond narrative

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.120
beyond nations beyond history possibly

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.519
even beyond species in some cases

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.560
there is a common insane experience

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:38.800
being a living thing

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.639
in a cosmos of apparently dead things

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.720
being a thing that doesn't just process

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:45.120
information but feels and hopes and

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.199
regrets and hate and longs and dreads

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.800
the never-ending chatter of ourselves

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:51.199
talking to ourselves

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.639
who am i i wonder how mum's doing i'm

00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:54.480
hungry i'm thirsty

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:56.480
should i be married by now i think the

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.800
milk is off do you still love me

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.320
i still love you how will i die when

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.760
will i be happy i should phone the post

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.360
office i should buy more toilet roll i

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.920
should worry less i should worry more

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.760
will anything ever make sense we don't

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.079
know how the consciousness trick is done

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.399
yet

00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:11.120
and to be honest maybe we never will but

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:13.760
even then

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.720
even if we never do the mystery is here

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.600
and it's gorgeous

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.000
and it's everywhere as gk chesterton put

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.399
it

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.920
but now a great thing in the street

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:24.560
seems any human nod

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.000
where shift in strange democracy the

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.399
million masks of

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.079
god it is not a pleasant condition to

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:31.519
endure living in an age when we know

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:33.199
more about the heavens than we do the

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:35.279
mechanisms of our own heads

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:37.040
personally some days i find it [ __ ]

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:39.680
horrifying but things

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.440
are changing inside the sciences today

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.639
it's finally becoming fashionable to

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.959
study consciousness

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:46.160
the science of how we experience is just

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:48.160
getting going now

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.440
science is coming home from its mad

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.680
flight in the stars

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.440
back down the telescope to ask about the

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.920
mind looking up the telescope

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.079
we're living at the birth of a theory of

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.480
us and i will bet you my cash

00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:02.320
on this in the miraculous event we

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.199
actually get through this teenage phase

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.120
in our development

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:06.560
we might stand the chance of maturing

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.399
into an adult species

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.240
we might live one day in a time of

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:10.800
perfect explanations and finished

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.480
science

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.240
when most things have been measured and

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.320
explained when the mechanisms of

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.560
consciousness and experience are as well

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.279
understood as the dynamics of flight are

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.360
today

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:23.600
but i will also bet you my cat that

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.680
there are eyes in that enlightened time

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.880
looking back longingly wishing they

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.600
could know what it was like

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.639
for us today to have lived in the great

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.160
age of mysteries

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:33.920
to have looked around and seen question

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.920
marks everywhere and found the courage

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.759
in spite of the dreadful uncertainties

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.759
in spite of not knowing how our souls

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:42.320
work to still carry on and still

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:43.839
be at least half decent back when humans

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.720
were clueless about their own mental

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:46.800
mechanisms

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.440
back in the quiet ignorance of the 21st

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.519
century in the days of wild unknowing

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.279
when all you needed to do to remind

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:54.079
yourself of how gorgeously weird the

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:56.240
world is

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:57.199
was to remember that for all we could

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.600
explain sound

00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:00.320
we had no idea how it became music in

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.000
our minds

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.320
and to remember that for all we could

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.279
explain light we had no idea how it

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.440
became color

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:09.920
when all that was required to remember

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.240
just how close the unknown is to us

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.680
was to look up to the horizon around

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.759
evening and to know

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.959
that for all the mysteries of the sky

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:19.040
and beyond the sky

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:20.399
for all the mysteries of our sun and the

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.120
dust she came from

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:23.839
on any given evening below any given

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.800
sunset

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:28.720
as the heavens look down on us clearly

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:36.320
the real mystery all along

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:37.519
was looking back up at the heavens

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.680
[ __ ] out that ending is too

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:41.839
pretentious even for me bogeys

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.199
willies etc don't forget to brush your

00:16:41.839 --> 00:16:46.320
teeth being alive is weird

00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:46.320
until next time then
