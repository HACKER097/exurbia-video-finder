00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
It so happened that I was sat in the sun with a book,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.400
and just as I was about to nod off, a little voice called out:

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.400
"Excuse me, what is this for?"

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.840
A small ant had crawled across the page of my book, and was now sat staring up at me.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.000
"What?" I said.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.620
"Excuse me," the ant said, "what is this for?"

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.320
"What is what for?" I said.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.500
"This great black and white expanse I'm standing on now," it tapped the book with a little black leg.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.220
"Look," I said, "you wouldn't understand even if I explained it to you."

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.340
"That might be so," the ant said, "but though I am very small, I am also very curious,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.660
and I don't want to turn to dust having known nothing at all.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.460
So, if you would, please – what is this for?"

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.720
He stood up on his two back legs, eagerly awaiting my answer,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.500
and his antennae stood to attention most respectfully. I said:

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.580
*Sigh* "It's like this: you're standing on a page. Pages are made from trees, we put lots of them together and call it a book."

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.760
"What is a book for, then?" the ant said.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.500
"Well, it stores thoughts," I said. "That way, we can transmit them to other people very far away."

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.840
"How?" the ant said.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.660
"Now, look, this isn't the time or place," I said, a little too firmly.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.780
The ant bowed his tiny head, and his antennae wilted.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.160
I said softly: "Look, you see those little black squiggles –

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.060
excuse me; to you, very big black squiggles about you on the page?"

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.100
The ant nodded.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.940
"Those are words and numbers."

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.260
"They don't look like words and numbers," the ant said.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.060
"They represent them," I said.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.100
"Hmm," the ant said and thought about this a while.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.040
I said: "Do you understand?"

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.940
The ant said: "Not really. You were right. It's beyond me. But though I'll never be as clever as you animals,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.040
I'm at least a little cleverer than I was a moment ago. So thank you for that."

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.380
"You're welcome", I said.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.460
"Well, good luck on being a thing in the world," the ant said.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.120
"Good luck to you, too," I said.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.460
The little ant made off on his way and disappeared into the grass.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.840
I read to the end of my page, but could not forget the little ant.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.480
Eventually, I looked up from the book – to the trees, to the mountain, to the sky.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.780
The moon was climbing up for evening, birds were migrating in the distance.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.980
I called out: "Excuse me, what is this for?"

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.500
"What?" came a booming voice above.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.640
"This great green and blue sphere I'm standing on now,"

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.420
I patted the ground with my foot,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.120
"What is all this for?"

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.340
"Look," the voice said, "you wouldn't understand even if I explained it to you."

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.020
"That might be so," I shouted, "but though I am very small, I am also very curious,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.460
and I don't want to turn to dust having known nothing at all.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.980
So, if you would, please – what is all this for?"

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.180
And the voice said:

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.860
*Sigh*

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.800
"It's like this..."
