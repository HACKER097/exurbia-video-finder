Frank Herbert

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.709
was a really clever guy who liked deserts and spacey Shit so

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.530
in 1965 he wrote Dune. The story starts on a planet about

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.380
20,000 years into the future where-Wait so several thousand years before the beginning of the book this guy called Holtzman gets into an accident

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.379
And just as he's about to die someone uploads his brain Into a computer and he studies all of the physics and invents like interstellar

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.750
travel and tells everyone how to do it. Anyway, thousands of tears after that mankind has a galactic empire. There's this itty-bitty

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.029
desert planet called Dune- Wait, hang on, so back up a second. We need to talk about the Bene Gesserit first who

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.020
were like the sacred order of chicks who have been around for ages

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.020
they can control people with a thing called "THE VOICE"

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.319
As, well as being resistant to poison, being able to choose the gender of their babies, choosing whether they conceive or not.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.070
And they've had this breeding program going on for ages where they want to breed the Kwisatz Haderach

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.919
Which is this perfect godlike creature that used to conquer the Universe, okay so now, we get to Dune which Is this- oh shit

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.820
okay, wait, sorry

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.459
one more thing. Um, so robots got a bit like

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.160
mouthy a few thousand years ago so humans Just wiped them out and now it's illegal to build an AI so everything has to be

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.699
done by humans, that means all

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.659
multiplication, addition and piloting fucking spaceships, so this class of people exists called the Mentats who are these slick

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.368
goofy head cats who are super duper clever. Now anyone who's anyone has their own personal Mentat for

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.220
strategizing or crossword puzzles or whatever and they come in three different flavors:

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.869
Hypothesizers who hypothesize, Memorizers who memorize and Processers who

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.369
Well, you get it, yeah? So this brings us to Dune, which is really called Arrakis, where the story starts with

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.869
Oh... yeah uh the emperor of the Galaxy is called the Emperor and he just, like, rules stuff

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.109
Cuz yeah. So Dune is- Oh and there's this stuff called spice and it's pretty much the most expensive commodity in the Universe because it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.720
slows aging and pilots use it to guide spaceships and Bene Gesserit chicks

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.319
take it to recall everything that happened to their ancestors ever (a bit like

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.050
Assassin's Creed but... better) and you can use it to make coats too and hats so that's nice, isn't it?

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.580
And the only place you can get spice is- 
Oh fuck what's it called? Uh uuh DUUUUUNE

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.979
Yes welcome to Arrakis

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.148
also known as Dune a desert planet where it's so hot you have to wear a special suit to keep the moisture in your body

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.349
and 100-foot sandworms chill in The desert and eat people. So there's the indigenous population, the Fremen,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.369
who have sexy blue glowing eyes because they use so much spice, and then there are the Houses. On Dune

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.589
we find House Harkonnen, who are generally quite fats and enjoy torture, and House Atreides, who are pretty good-looking and the governed by this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.770
guy called Leto Atreides.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.219
Leto has a son called Paul and a wife who's kind of secretly Bene Gesserit and was supposed to have a daughter but loved

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.169
Leto so much she gave him a son instead, and the Bene Gesserit are, like, quite pissed about this because it sort of fucked up their

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.240
breeding program, and the whole Atreides family have come to Dune to wrestle control the spice from the Harkonnen, who were probably just eating it anyway.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.240
Things go, uh, less than well and the Harkonnen's pretty much destroyed, House Atreides killing Leto and forcing

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.890
his wife and child into the desert. There they

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.080
Join forces with the Fremen and Jessica teaches them to do all that Bene Gesserit nonsense and everyone becomes a wizard. Jessica drinks

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.709
concentrated spice becoming a cosmic badass meanwhile bestowing the same power

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.789
on her Daughter Alia, who is still in the womb. After loads of spice and having all that training from his mom

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.969
Paul begins to see into the future and concocts a plan to begin the jihad against the Harkonnen using the Fremen. However, he

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.320
also sees that if he's not careful the Fremen will go too far with it and take the jihad out into space and just generally

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.109
fuck everything up. Just for good measure, he knocks up a Fremen chick

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.510
and has a son who he calls Leto after his dead father but he gets a bit like killed later so we don't have to talk about him.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.760
Meanwhile Alia, Paul's wizardy sister, is captured by the Harkonnen but it's alright because she kills the Baron Harkonnen because she's, you know,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.709
got wizard shit going on. Paul has more or less become the head of the Fremen and under the cover of a sandstorm leads an

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.079
attack on the capital city where the Harkonnens are hauled up. He confronts the newly installed baron Harkonnen, who's like "Could you fuck

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.059
off a bit, please?" and Paul stabs him up quite bad. And now in control of Arrakis, Paul gives the Emperor a little ring on

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.070
the old dog and bone and says "Alright  you old China (?)

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.640
yeah, that spice thing

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.260
Uh that's mine now so if you don't stop being Emperor I'm gonna blow it all up and that means

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.170
no more space travel. Okay?" And he gives the Bene Gesserit a ring aswell

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.699
and says much the same thing and everyone pretty much bows down to Paul and Paul becomes Johnny Big Balls of Dune and the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.700
Galaxy. Marries the daughter to the Emperor and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.950
GAME OV- except in his visions of the future he realizes even though he

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.419
was really careful the Fremen are still gonna take their jihad out to the stars anyway, so good job Paul, good job.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.490
But what a bloody pickle you're in now, eh? DUUUUUUNE
