00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.280
Uh, yeah, I'm still just a bit on edge. Can you inject some apathy?

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.880
Ah, yeah, that's- that's it. Just-

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.920
one more milliliter in the back of the neck.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.220
Yeah, much... much better. Thanks...

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.140
*Microphone feedback*

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.720
Hi, uh... Hello.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.880
Yes, uh, thanks for coming, uh... thanks to the speakers so far...

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.760
So, if your mental projectors are working, can you just turn them on now, please?

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.640
*Intermittent static*

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.040
Right, thanks, so...

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.240
I'm here today to talk about Earth history-

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.160
uh, this is- oh, uh- holiday photos...

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.660
Ah- ancient historical footage...

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
Ah, there, there we are. So, we've all heard of a bridge tongue before, have we?..

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.320
No? Well, that's a linguistic term.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.230
Uh, it was basically a language spoken by our ancestors, that you could use to talk to anyone about pretty much anything,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.000
and yes, I know, that sounds ridiculous. But these were... savage times.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.780
Originally, every language was a bridge tongue –

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.260
uh, this is one of the most widely spoken bridge tongues for a while on the mother planet –

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.340
"Anglish". Now,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.940
obviously, today one speaks the language of the bubble they're born into –

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.580
uh, here at the Galactic Council of Pointless Academia, we speak Academish,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.540
uh, politicians speak Polijistics,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.900
uh, meme warriors speak Spicy –

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.420
but back then language, uh, the bridge tongues –

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.680
they were multi-purpose. You could speak to anyone at all.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.760
Uh, a ludicrous idea, of course...

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.040
This is one dead phrase we found in the bridge tongue archives; now,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.280
it means something close to "that doesn't make sense", or "that doesn't follow" –

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.240
see, people who didn't agree on contentious issues actually used to socialize together back then.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.980
Sometimes the two of you could bring up these viewpoints without calling each other total pieces of shit –

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.180
uh, barbaric times, I know.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.800
We refer to this as the Pre-Bubble Era.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.720
Now, the history buffs among you will know that social media changed a lot of this, and-

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.740
S-sorry, is that a question at the back?

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.000
No, it's... it's alright, I- I do speak Software.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.720
*Trumpety beeping*

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.040
Ah, our digital friend asks what people did before dedicated communication bubbles.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.180
Well, it's strange, because... when the global net was born, people thought it would make conversations easier to have,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.360
and we'd actually reach conclusions on things –

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.500
how to live together, which movies were better, etc. –

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.060
that mankind would naturally develop a global wide sense of concern for itself, regardless of opinions about current events, and...

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.040
Thank God we put a stop to that, eh?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.740
Now, thanks to what was called AI it became possible to exist in entirely separate, digital bubbles from each other,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.120
eventually, without ever having to encounter points of view one might not entirely agree with.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.280
This is, of course, the best way for a civilization to flourish –

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.240
all differing opinions never having to encounter each other because,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.480
as we know, humans can't think for themselves, and

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.500
haven't been doing so for thousands and thousands of years now.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.720
Most of you, presumably, have an account with the galactic social platform, Spacebook©,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.060
free to use now for four centuries,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.880
the only requirement being that you submit your bank details, blood type, an entire DNA profile to Spacebook© Incorporated, but...

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.120
we know from the social media graveyards of old that there was a concept in the bridge tongues

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.360
called "privacy".

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.620
Now, I promise, I'm not shitting you here, but...

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.480
back then they sometimes preferred not sharing everything all the time.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.080
There are even reports that sometimes people watched fireworks, and... felt no need to film it.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.300
Fucking idiots.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.460
Stranger, there was no social rating, so...

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.640
if you met someone, it was impossible to know what public opinion of them was,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.840
and you had to actually judge the contents of their character –

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.780
it's hard to imagine a bigger waste of time than that.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.340
Now, some more common expressions in the bridge tongues that we found.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.260
Uh, my personal favorite is this – uh, I believe it's pronounced "I don't know".

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.100
Back then, it was actually possible to admit one didn't know something about the world.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.980
Luckily, we've removed any possibility of this from our specialized languages today.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.640
"Sorry" – that was another ancient word.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.740
We're not even sure what that one means – it sounds like it might be an artificial sweetener.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.280
And finally, this arcane figure of speech:

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.460
"I don't agree with your opinion, but it's fine that you have it."

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.280
One struggles to even imagine an attitude more backwards than that.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.600
Truly, our ancestors must have been living in a dystopian nightmare,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.600
surrounded by people with different views, and somehow still managing to get along with each other on a daily basis,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.280
or even communicating with people we disagreed with, using the now dead bridge tongues.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.900
But luckily, as the scope of the global net was widened, it became possible to contain more and more differing viewpoints, and

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.040
one could live an entire lifetime without ever having to encounter someone one disagreed with,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.280
bringing us into what we now call the First Bubble Era.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.920
Thankfully, we have now eliminated all languages capable of connecting people with differing points of view,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.160
fractured communication to the point that humans now essentially live in their own walled-off realities,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.900
and ensure that no one need ever change their minds regarding anything ever again.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.560
Now, if you'll please stand for the human galactic anthem.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.460
Yeah, yeah, just inject a bit of galactic loyalty...

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.280
Ah, that's much better. Thanks, thanks...

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.180
Well, since you asked... ;)

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.980
It is called The Fifth Science.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.420
It is 12 short stories about humans spreading out into the galaxy, building an empire.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.980
It goes on for a hundred thousand years of human history,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.900
right up until the point that we go extinct.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.400
It is about technological gods, and misery, and falling in love,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.440
and how to make non-conscious things conscious,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.280
and why teleporters are a shit idea,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.000
and what happens after we solve science,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.200
and why we will always be a bit sad.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.580
If you were ever curious about my books, and you haven't tried my bullshit yet –

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.120
this might be the one, because I put a lot of love into these stories.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.560
Yeah, I know, "Where the fuck is Logic Beach Part 2", almost no one is asking.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.740
It just wasn't working, and it made me want to kill myself, and I'll get around to it,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.300
but I didn't want to just put out any old rubbish for the sake of it.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.660
Anyway, I have put one of the stories from The Fifth Science – the new book –

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.620
up on my other channel, as read by me, in an attempt to get you interested.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.180
Link below, if you want.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.320
Obviously, thank you to everyone on Patreon.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.780
Like everything I do, it wouldn't exist without you.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.360
You are fantastical, and thanks, and thanks, and thanks.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.860
I should have already sent the thing out to you for free, anyway.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.020
It should also be coming out shortly as a paperback,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.580
so that's cool – I'll let you know.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.340
Thanks for tolerating this shameless plug –

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.220
I really just hope you like the book, because I had lots of fun writing this one.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.240
Благодаря ви, [Bulgarian – "Thank you"]
and thank you again, you bloody animals.
