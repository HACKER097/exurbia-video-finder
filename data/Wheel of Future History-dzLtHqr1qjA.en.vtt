00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
Are you worried about the future?

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.880
Are you concerned for your species' survival?

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.640
Are your tentacles lacking wetness, or even chapping slightly?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.240
Well for the last one, try Octo-moist.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.660
Octo-moist.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.620
Moistness when it matters.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.560
*octo-jingle plays*

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.000
Not suitable for heptapods.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.200
For the first two though, well, it's time to play another game of...

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.920
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.020
of Future History.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.840
Our next contestant today is called-

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.980
*aside* fuck are they called?

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.620
Ah yes, Hu-mans. Yes, well, come on up then, don't be shy.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.469
Yes, big hand for the Monkeys. Big hand.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.340
Yes, that's enough, shut up.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.580
Right, hu-mans.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.160
You know the rules of the game do you?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.580
No? Well the main aim of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.660
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeel

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600
of Future History is...

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.920
Not to go extinct as a species.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.420
Your species, well, let's just say things are about to get a little bit bumpy.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.099
Now Margery here- MARGERY WAKE UP YOU LEPTON

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.180
Is going to give the wheel of Future History a spin and find out where the human species is going.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.100
Could be amazing.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.880
Could be mega shit. So let's see what you could end up winning.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.940
Well firstly there are the utopias

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.200
They come in several flavors, there is:

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.460
Technological utopia. You might master automation, relieving all humans of labor jobs, banishing any need for human employment allowing your species to,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.540
well, pursue whatever they want to.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.720
Robotics and algorithms will tend to almost all unwanted work and facilitate blissful daily living.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.960
Since there'll be no scarcity there will be almost no conflict

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.340
Meaning war vanishes, and humans live perpetually in peace forevermore mostly eating nice food,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.620
Reproducing very loudly, and having a jolly old time.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.040
Okay, I hear you ask. But will there be dogs?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.580
Yes. There will.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.100
There's also AI utopia. machine intelligence is able to assist if not take over a number of human projects including science, design,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.580
administration, and diplomacy. And streamlines and improves each area respectively,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.560
and radically raises the general global standard of human living for all-

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.020
and no Skynet shit.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.480
There's also scientific utopia: aging is treated as an illness and cured. Disease has also been eradicated

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.300
Death has become voluntary, particle physics is finished, and a successful theory of everything unites general relativity and quantum mechanics

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.300
(called string theory). The origin of biology is understood. Toast no longer falls butter side down

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.360
Consciousnesses explained scientifically.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.720
The mechanisms of reality itself are now out in the open, and your race is no longer a bumbling pack of confused idiots.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.820
No offense.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.340
Then there's ecological utopia: your species begins living in harmony with nature,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.320
Stops being dicks to the planet, and returns to a subsistence way of living in conjunction with high technology.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.640
Industry still exists but is entirely sustainable,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.160
And Mother Nature is allowed to reassert her sovereignty over the planet.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.340
Everything is kind of organic

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.840
But not shit and hipstery, just... nice

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.620
Political utopia: political conflict is rendered pointless and citizens never have to worry about their offspring ending up in Wars

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.140
Governments are able to put their energy and influence into improving the welfare of their own citizens and the world goes full-on Scandinavian

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.280
Oh, yeah

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.300
Cake is free all the time and also there are dogs.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.900
And finally the main prize,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.620
Galactic utopia.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.760
You begin colonizing other planets in the solar system

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.539
And maybe even perfect faster-than-light travel and colonize other star systems, too.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.300
Even if there's an extinction event on your home planet, your race will now survive indefinitely

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.860
Up until all cosmic resources run out or you reverse cosmic entropy itself.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.480
The golden age of trade and cooperation dawns,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.500
As well as exploration of the known and unknown universe, and humanity is unified into a single great empire.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.000
Humans finally take their rightful place in the heavens,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.500
utilizing entire galaxies for energy to fuel their godlike projects.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.060
Knowledge and wisdom guide your civilization forever more,

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.940
Petty squabbles are a thing of the past, the very cosmos itself revels in your success.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.900
It goes without saying that there's free cake and dogs and stuff.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.000
But, for every utopia there is of course a dystopia

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.780
And if you bollocks up the future you might instead get

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.740
Technological dystopia: technology is instead used for controlling populations including constant surveillance and mass misinformation.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.180
No, one is considered an authority on anything anymore.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.560
Possibly humans are genetically engineered in such a way that they cease to be human or most of their functions are outperformed by machines.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.920
Humans are obsolete and miserable and technology serves to enslave rather than liberate your species.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.180
AI dystopia: Artificial intelligence either commandeers or subverts human history and does not have the species best interests at heart,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.570
Or is too powerful with not enough safety parameters. In short, everything is either miserable or thermonuclear and game over for the entire species.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.760
Ecological dystopia: you mess up the planet to the point of no return, over fish the oceans, ruin the atmosphere, etc.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.160
Earth is no longer capable of supporting mammalian life, and extinction ensues for your entire species.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.900
Political dystopia: either earth becomes united by a single tyrannical government or most governments turn tyrannical.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.840
But in any case, it's horrific, and politicking has been perfected to such an extent that no one can effectively rise up against it.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.700
Possible lasting famine, enslavement, utter depravity and ruin for the species with no hope of recovery.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.540
Or the non galactic scenario:

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.060
Humans never bothered with reaching other planets let alone the rest of the galaxy.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.460
A single mass extinction means total obliteration for silly petrol monkeys,

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.920
and a human space Empire is never constructed.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.920
Mankind goes gentle into that good night.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.600
Wild animals reclaim the cities,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.600
Satellites fall back to earth, and within a few thousand years,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.600
Passing extraterrestrials wouldn't even have an inkling your species ever existed, let alone flourished for a time.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.720
And there are a few other scenarios of course.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.280
Maybe you merge with technology to become a cyber species

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.180
Or there's a Nickleback revival tour,

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.280
Or political collapse returning you to the dark ages and never recovering,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.180
Or you use genetics to elevate other species to the level of human sentience and immediately regret that decision,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.360
(Dolphins fucking hate you by the way.)

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.320
Or you create simulated reality that's so convincing and malleable, humans mostly lose interest in actual reality

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.320
Assuming this is actual reality.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.720
Or you reach the end of Technology and find out the lots of stuff just isn't possible,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.279
And instead stay content with free cake, and dogs and stuff,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.140
Which is alright.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.660
Or one of 10 million other disaster scenarios. Economic, political, technological, whatever.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.680
Meaning the obliteration of your species.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.580
And that is the wheeeeeel of future history.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.440
And those are the rules.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.400
So how do you go about winning, then?

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.760
Well, that's a bit more complicated.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.840
If you can wield technology your ancestors never dreamt of and use that power in a way they would be proud;

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.760
If you can utilize your birth planet without destroying it, yet still take all that you need;

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.540
If you can kill labor without killing ambition;

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.440
If you can create administrations without giving birth to tyranny;

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.240
If you can think as a collective without losing individuality;

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.140
If you can expand your reach without diminishing your integrity;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.020
If you can unravel nature without thinking yourself smarter than her;

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.380
If you contain the elements without subverting them;

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.680
If you can build your homes on distant worlds while still taking care of the home you evolved on;

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.820
If you can safeguard for future generations without forgetting those who came before;

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.020
If you can accept your violent pasts while still fostering your galactic future;

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.940
If you can spread across the Stars without your empire spreading too thin;

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.700
If you can take to the Galactic stage without forgetting your lines;

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.860
Then yours is the cosmos, and everything that's in it.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.740
And more than that,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.120
Then you'll be a mankind my son.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.280
Then you'll be a mankind.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.780
Well, it's time.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.780
Marjorie, spin the wheel please.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.040
So good luck. It's been an absolute pleasure watching you develop as a species, I guess.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.220
And you know petrol monkeys,

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.529
You've done some pretty stupid shit over the years, but there is cause for optimism. Because despite all of your idiocy,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.880
you've still somehow managed to find the time for...

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.440
Exploration,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.000
science,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.780
technology,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.560
culture,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.360
civilization,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.220
philanthropy,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.800
fiction,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.560
genius,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.340
collaboration,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.000
language,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.520
the arts,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.180
endeavor,

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.980
curiosity,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.700
daring,

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.420
persistence, and rationality.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.420
Look, you've survived hundreds of thousands of generations, yeah?

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.719
Famine, drought, and war. And you've got a global civilization now.

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:41.660
You might be living on other planets in no time, or cracking the really big secrets of nature,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.988
Or just getting over all your monkey rubbish and having a good time.

00:07:43.988 --> 00:07:49.520
You're gonna feel mighty silly if you screw it all up because you got too clever, or too fighty, or too apathetic.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.560
What do you think those are? They're not window dressing, they're an invitation.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.060
But you have to behave yourself until you get there, all right?

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.860
For the sake of everyone who came before and everyone who will come after, there may not be another chance now.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.720
Don't fuck it up, monkeys.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.300
Not before you conquer your primitive tendencies,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.260
Not before you spread out into space,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.320
Or at the very least,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.800
Not before all your great ambitions have finally run dry.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.200
And speaking of dryness, Wheel of Future History is proudly sponsored by octo-moi-
