00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
So one day you have an idea and you decide to make a thing.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.840
Might be an app, movie, business, video game...

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.780
Might be a painting of your own willy, done entirely in toothpaste.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.460
Whatever.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.800
Now, you probably start with some good stats.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.780
Maybe plus 10 creativity, plus 15 charisma, plus 20 self-esteem.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.840
Well, that's grand.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320
You also have a map, showing the way to your thing.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.520
Look, there it is. A straight line.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.540
So off you trot, and everything is going great, only...

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.980
Okay, minor difficulties, because you don't actually know how to do your thing yet.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.260
Obviously you need to learn to code, or write, or use a camera, or whatever.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.000
I mean, okay. There is a small wiggle in the map, but so what?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.640
When your project is done, which will be in like a month, it's going to be great.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.540
Remember that.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.820
You'll just work really hard. It's fine.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.900
Oh, what? Here comes another hitch.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.580
Maybe you're tired in the evenings when you get back from work and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.200
you don't wanna spend all your time on your project, but that's okay.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.480
Keep going, you'll be alright.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.580
Nothing worth doing was ever easy, huh?

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.700
Oh, okay. Money trouble slash no time.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.880
But don't worry, it's alright. And... I... Yes, sorry, that's -

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.740
[Minus 10 points determination]

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.980
But carry on, and... Okay, trouble at work.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.400
Don't worry about it. You'll be alright.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.260
[Minus 15 emotional resolve]

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.340
Hey, you can use all that sad energy to make something really brilliant.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.460
[Plus 15 angst]

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.180
Yeah, screw the naysayers, screw mrs. Collins in year 5

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840
and all that bullshit she said about your crappy work ethic.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.440
Here comes the big time, captain.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.440
It's just around the corner, hopefully.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.640
All right. It's been months now and you haven't made much progress and...

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.620
Jesus Christ, does that line have a lot of wiggles in it. But just - you're going to be fine.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.780
Remember that thing you're trying to finish. Whatever it was, it's going-

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.860
It's going to be great.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.020
You're broke and you haven't seen your friends in weeks, but look:

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.700
you've started now, so you better bloody well finish.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.520
Okay. There are a lot of problems with the project.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.840
Coding is quite hard as it turns out, or

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.940
some days you just don't want to write, or

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.460
starting a business with very little money is extremely tiring.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.560
Just hang in there, and-
[Minus 20 determination]

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.440
[Minus 15 self-esteem]

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.460
[Minus 10 will to live]

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.620
Just keep working. It's all right.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.420
(God, why did you even start this?)
[Minus 10 self-esteem]

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.340
No, just shut up. Stop being so hard on yourself, idiot. You never do anything right.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.950
[Minus 20 self-esteem.]
God this is just so typical.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.920
You're always chasing after stupid pipe dreams that'll never work.
[Minus 30 self-esteem]

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000
This is probably why dad never bought you that fucking Etch-a-sketch.
[Minus 100 self-esteem]

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.980
And- oh... That's nice. It's a chance meeting with a friend who says some wise things.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.320
They've been through hard times and they're still alive.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.820
Keep going, they tell you. You'll be all right.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.240
Plus 50 self-esteem.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.560
That's ironed out a few kinks and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.940
You're a little further along now.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.340
It's funny, while the thing was only in your head, you didn't really imagine there would be any problems.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.480
Who would have thought coding or an app or starting a business

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.760
or making a documentary would be so difficult.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.780
Well, you know all about that now.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.160
Plus 20 wisdom

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.040
Super Duper.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.780
Of course there was going to be resistance.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.820
Of course people were going to tell you it's impossible.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.880
Well, you'll show them and boy are people going to love this shit when you're done.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.760
Everything is going to be alright after all.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.500
Maybe good things do happen.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.700
Maybe everything is going to turn out fantastically.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.740
Maybe you're going to live in a mansion and spend all day eating Cadbury's creme eggs

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.580
and watching Amelie over and over.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.620
Maybe CrossFit is actually good for you.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.460
And maybe-
[skeptical comments from friends and family]

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.940
[Minus 50 determination]

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.920
Oh it's fine. What do they know?
[No funding slash money]

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.380
[Minus 50 determination]

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.240
Hang in there. It's okay. This thing is going to be great.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.240
Carry on and maintain your resolve. What's the wors-

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.940
(God. Am I secretly an idiot for believing in my own ambition?)

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.940
[Minus 50 resistance to mockery]

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.280
(Maybe everything Mrs. Collins said in year five was true.)

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.900
[Minus 500 self-esteem]

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.400
But- Oh, thank god. Just a little further now.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.400
Look how far you've come. You're home and dry.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.940
The manuscript is almost finished.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.800
Or the documentary is almost shot.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.100
Or the business is almost set up

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.900
and the toothpaste is perfectly aligned.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.420
All that effort is going to pay off and everything is going to be fine.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.640
And only a few more steps. My god, if you'd only know what you're getting into.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.260
But surely it can't get any worse.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.300
Surely this is the final hurdle and just a few steps away is...

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.340
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! FUCK!

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.720
Oh and here comes a health crisis: bout of weight gain.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.720
Your family expects you to settle down already.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.080
Other friends having good jobs.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.440
No energy. No fun. No money. And the undeniable sense that you're wasting your time.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.440
The map is fucked! You should have gone to law school.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.140
You're in over your head. The whole world is waiting for you to fail.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.300
It's all been done before. There are no new ideas.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.720
Move to the woods, eat rice and die alone.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.460
My god you're getting older. No one will give a damn when you're finished with this.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.740
And how did you get into this mess and why try anything when it's doomed to fail?

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.540
What does fun feel like again? What does having free time feel like again?

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.140
*Crash cymbals intensifies*
Did Tony Robbins lie about everything?

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.300
*Drums intensifies*

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.440
*CYMBAL!*

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.500
And one day, unexpectedly, you wake up to find, in spite of all the odds

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.020
that your project is indeed finished.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.100
And maybe it was good and successful, or maybe people said mean things

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.400
but you learned a shitload in the process.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.920
And you know now that in order to shit fire, one must first chew glass.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.420
That has been the prerequisite for almost all great art, and endeavour and invention.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.200
All of the great writers, scientists, pioneers, entrepreneurs and generally decent humans

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.700
had a hard time doing stuff.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.700
They hated their work, doubted themselves, lost friends, made enemies, spent years broke.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.800
But the single common theme is they may have screwed up a few times.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.680
Usually a lot.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.860
But they always kept their eye on whatever it was they wanted to finish.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.380
And when that thing was finished, they went on to the next project.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.660
That appears to be how the game works.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.080
Or... Okay, to put it another way...

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.380
Projects are hard, self-doubt isn't clever,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.740
so make lots of stuff before you're dead forever.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.000
Goodbye.
