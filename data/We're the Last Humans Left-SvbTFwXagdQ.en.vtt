00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.260
Our species probably began about 200,000 years ago.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.260
And judging by the fucking state of us, I think we can all agree it was a terrible idea.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.620
We are called Homo Sapiens, but we were not the first human-like creatures on the planet, however.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.400
Homo Habilis were making tools about 2 million years ago,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.960
Homo Heidelbergensis were building shelters about 700,000 years ago,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.480
Neanderthals were probably just as brainy as us:

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.380
they wore jewelry,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.500
maybe buried their dead,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.220
and always passed the joint to the left.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.720
There were at least 15 other human species we know about – and now they are all gone.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.440
The last three surviving species of human were Neanderthals, who probably died out about 30,000 years ago,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.300
Homo Floresiensis, who disappeared about 12,000 years ago,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.760
and us – Homo Sapiens, aka...

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.380
BIPEDAL BASTARDS.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860
And if you hadn't noticed, we are still here.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.480
So where be dem other hominids... yo?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.260
Neanderthals, for example?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.800
Neanderthals were probably stronger than us, a bit taller,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040
with a rather different skull and a bigger brain.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.560
Then why are they gone?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.500
You see, old Gary Neanderthal might have been a smarty-pants,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.900
but we had a secret weapon...

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.640
which is mouthy word noises.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.760
Speech is fine for dissing and cussing, but it lets you do other stuff – like organize.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.780
This allows you to, as the evolutionary biologists put it,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.160
F U C K S H I T U P

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.700
Neanderthals were hanging about in Europe, doing crochet, cracking open cold ones,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.840
until around 45,000 years ago, when us sapiens turned up coming from East Africa.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.980
And within 5000 years of meeting us...

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.760
They were gone. All of them.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.420
[wind noises]

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.940
Combine that with the fact that we could make big wordy noises,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.020
were socially complex,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.740
and probably had domesticated doggos at some point for help –

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.900
and we were a force to be reckoned with.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.900
So that was that. We were bumming around for a while as hunter-gatherers.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.120
The land was often barren,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.540
the climate was often hostile,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.820
death lurked everywhere –

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.700
so, Portsmouth, basically –

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.240
but it really wasn't all bad.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.400
We think the average work week might have been around twenty to forty hours.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.060
Their diet was probably quite varied –

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.880
vegetables, fruit, nuts, insects, boza — whatever they could find.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.280
And they weren't idiots.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.080
Most members of the tribe had to know the core skills of survival:

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.040
which berries will make you dead immediately,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.200
how to remember the terrain,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.040
how to build tools, how to stay alive...

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.780
They were generalists. They had to be.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.840
Anyway, that went on for a few hundred thousand years,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.520
until we got around to developing agriculture – probably about 12,000 years ago.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.240
And suddenly, "if we don't find food, we'll all die"

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.760
turned into "if you eat my food, YOU'LL die",

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.720
then into "ehhh, I'm full, but I'll eat some more",

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.900
and then into...

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.020
"Uhh, yeah, I'll have the gluten-free macaroon and the lactose-free avocado shake.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.680
Merci beaucoup..."

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.080
And then we went off to build society.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.140
Hooooow?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.620
Scrawny, breakable, generally pathetic –

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.860
but enough about myself (lol dat twist tho).

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.400
We are not a formidable species physically. But we can do language.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.980
And if you can do language, then you can do myths.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.120
And if you can do myths – then you can conquer the world.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.900
You will own at least hundreds of thousands of objects in your life,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.200
because you believe in a myth called "money".

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.180
"If you give me this paper, and the number is right, I will give you stuff."

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.980
And the myth works, because most of us agree to play by the rules.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.640
The same applies to universities, governments, nations – whatever it is.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.220
It's not that these things are lies, it's just that they're abstractions that only live in our heads.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.620
And if you don't have language...

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.420
you can't do them. You really can't.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.180
And if you can't do them, you can't do big societies.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.700
Language is probably the gateway to civilization.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.180
And now... we own the fucking world.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.700
But it's been quite a journey.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.220
There is some evidence that around a hundred thousand years ago the human species bottlenecked

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.460
to somewhere between 3,000 and 10,000 humans in the entire world.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.980
By definition, that made us an endangered species teetering on the edge of extinction.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.360
One theory holds that this was thanks to a supervolcano in lake Toba, Indonesia,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.560
possibly bringing in a volcanic winter.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.200
And even if that wasn't the cause –

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.620
disease, strife, famine, ignorance and hardship weren't occasional visitors to the human condition.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.220
They WERE the human condition for most of our history.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.280
But here we are now – a most populated planet.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.240
For better or worse, we have arrived.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.300
It took two hundred thousand years to get to our first billion humans – that was in 1804.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.620
But then we jumped 2 billion in 1927,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.500
and then 3 billion in 1959,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.180
4 billion in 1974 –

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.140
and finally, 7 billion in 2007.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.100
And now, we are invincible.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.740
We've outsmarted time, we've outsmarted death,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.760
we've outsmarted crops, and disease, and the weather...

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.240
The state of the human union is strong.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:21.760
What could possibly go wrong now?
[echoing]

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.580
I met a traveller from an antique land

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.520
Who said:—Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.400
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.740
Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.640
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.700
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.920
Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.120
The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.040
And on the pedestal these words appear:

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.660
"My name is Homo sapiens, hominid of hominids:

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.000
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.580
Well... Then again.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.460
In 1977, a probe was launched into space, called "Voyager 1".

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.380
41 years later, Voyager 1 is traveling away from us at about 38,000 miles an hour,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.720
and is now 13 billion miles distant.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.240
And aboard Voyager is a message from Jimmy Carter,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.800
the 39th President of the United States.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.420
And the message reads:

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.580
"This is a present from a small distant world,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.900
a token of our sounds, our science, our images,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.800
our music, our thoughts, and our feelings.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.740
We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.680
We hope some day, having solved the problems we face,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.600
to join a community of galactic civilizations.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.560
This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.800
in a vast and awesome universe."

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.080
And were we able to include just a few more lines in that message,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.860
to tell our spacey friends a little more about ourselves,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.200
and our deep history, and our ambitions, and our ancestors,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.900
Just maybe it would say that...

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.960
"Well... P. S.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.940
We think shit went down like this:

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.200
Life probably began on our planet about 4 billion years ago – a simple organic machines,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.840
we don't know how yet. Then a sudden explosion of diversity 500 million years ago.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.740
50 million more years, and plants taking the land over; 50 million more, and insects have arrived;

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.920
next, the dinosaurs are taking the stage, 700 species at least,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.700
ruling the planet for around 145 million years,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.580
before something – possibly asteroid shaped – wipes them out.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.040
But it's ok, because here come bats, and butterflies, giraffes, bears, hyenas, sloths,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.680
vultures, mammoths, TURTLES – you fucking name it!

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.600
And then the rise of the primates, and 2 million years ago appear our first true ancestor – Homo Habilis.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.460
And at least 15 other species of the Homo genus spreading out across the world

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.220
until about 200,000 years ago, when a new genus – our genus – emerges.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.300
Homo Sapiens, large-brained organizers, talkers, thinkers,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.920
capable of high abstraction, and building tribes and cities and nation-states,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.940
capable of ending the world in a day!

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.720
We have stepped into an age of great technological potency, though there are gaping holes in our wisdom.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.780
We've become a global superorganism, though we still harbor our tribal inclinations.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.080
We've pulled a bunch of fuckups, and we're really quite confused, and alone, and, frankly, scared.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.840
But we hope to enjoy the privilege of being a semicolon in history, rather than a full-stop.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.120
So on behalf of the hundred and fifty billion who came before us, and our human cousins who didn't make it,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.560
we just hope this message finds you well.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.200
And we hope, when you find us thousands of years from now,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.720
that we are well too.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.980
In any case... please just write back.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.600
It's dark out here.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.600
And we're the last humans left."
