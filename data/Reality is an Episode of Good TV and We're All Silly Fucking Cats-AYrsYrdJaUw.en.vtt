00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
A few days ago, I was watching TV with the destroyer of worlds

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.640
And it got me thinking what does she actually think TV is?

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.705
If you could build a little universal translator for kitten brains,

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:15.620
what would come out?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.500
Yes, that's Catelyn Stark and she's married to Ned stark and

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.876
[Which one is Legolas again?]

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:23.999
No, he's in Lord...

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.769
FUCK'S SAK-

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.620
And that got me thinking

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.400
well even if she spoke perfect English she still couldn't make sense of TV because she doesn't know what TV is

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.360
or fiction or sword fights or cheeky feudal incest

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.419
and she never will

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.880
There's an upper limit to the intelligence of her species

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.591
and there must be an upper limit to our intelligence too

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.880
to the human species

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.640
Let's call it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.940
"The Understanding Line"

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.836
Imagine it, right?

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.200
The cat has an understanding line somewhere

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.020
and before that line she understands food and litter trays a nd mice

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.920
and how to wake her owner up at 3:00 in the morning to party because she's a little cu-

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.220
But what about over that line?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.580
What about the stuff she can never understand?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.420
Well, basic requests, that's one

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.890
Cattington fetch me my breakfast opium would you?

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.980
NOW CATTINGTON!

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.520
as well as Portuguese, Jam sandwiches, particle physics and Hooters

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.200
And she won't ever understand these things

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.260
she can't

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.040
The limit? Her understanding line is built into her adorable

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.970
but somewhat lacking brain

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.540
well

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.500
What about us? All of the collective brains of everyone who has ever lived adds up

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.700
and pushes our understanding line to here.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.443
Which is where we are now in this century.

00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:32.480
And thanks to all of that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.699
we have civilization and Keynesian Economics and butt stuff.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.049
And we'll keep making geniuses and we'll keep pushing the line in an attempt to understand nature

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.180
But can it go on forever until we've licked everything?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.900
well

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.940
Maybe not.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.577
At some point the size of our brains might limit us in what we can understand

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.580
and the line can't be pushed anymore

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.400
we can't go further than that

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.400
*cough* without AI

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.500
and the problem is that we can't even imagine what's over that line by definition.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.089
So there must be two types of truth

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.802
Stuff we don't understand yet, but can

00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:04.160
and stuff we don't understand yet, and never can

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.268
This is Bulgarian.

00:02:05.268 --> 00:02:08.240
If you can't read Cyrillic, it might look a bit like silliness,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.160
however it's pronounced roughly "Ti prost li si, be?"
which means "Hey chum, how's it going?"

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.759
Make sure you say this to any Bulgarians you meet and you are certain to make only the BEST of first impressions.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.510
There you go.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.799
You can read a bit of Cyrillic. We went from no understanding to understanding in about 15 seconds

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.620
Because you're a human and humans are, like, well, clever

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.750
But what about the things we might never

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.580
Understand?

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.640
Is there a system after maths, for example, that better describes the Universe?

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.960
Is there some ground structure to creation that we just can't discern?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.220
What are women doing when they all go off to the loo at the same time, exactly?

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.820
What the fffuck is that all about?

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.360
The solutions to Quantum Gravity and faster than light travel might be staring us in the face

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.820
and we just can't quite grab them

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.260
because we're too dopey

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.780
not because we don't understand yet, but because we might never understand

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.300
because

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.260
Monkey Brains

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.760
if the cat was a bit smarter

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.160
She would understand that right in front of her is an epic story of betrayal and death and certain weddings gone a bit UH-OH

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.620
But for her it's just flashy lights and weird sounds because she's too silly

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.020
Is it the same for us with reality?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.680
Are we missing something really obvious because we're just too dumb?

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.760
What do these do, exactly?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.560
And these?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.740
And what's the point of this?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.640
What if there is some grand function to the cosmos like a massive computer or in a laboratory for baby gods or something

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.940
and we're Just sat on our bluey-green spaceship with our thumbs up our asses

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.240
missing the point entirely?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.040
*dumb voices*

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.100
Because of this line how much information do we already have that if we just interpreted it in the right way

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.369
we could solve physics, kill war and just become better humans, but we keep missing because of this line?

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.834
And how many stupid decisions are we repeating over and over again in our lives

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.480
and the same dumb patterns of behavior that we kind of notice, but refuse to change

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.140
because of this fucking line?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.820
But hang on.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.240
There is a nice twist to this

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.369
Yes, we are limited, but think for a second

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.200
how far we've come already with those limits

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.630
how much we've invented and discovered with outdated

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.400
stupid prehistoric brains that were mostly good for foraging and working out who was boning who.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.760
Why is there such a gap between animal intelligence and humans?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.180
Why was evolution so lovely to us?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.060
And what will we discover when the next Einstein or Newton is born?

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.300
Can we ever push the understanding line right to the very edge?

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.760
To see space and time

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.980
and cause and effect

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.040
and good and evil

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.420
and quarks and galaxies

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.920
for what they really are in themselves?

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.880
If we can't that's no surprise.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.480
And if we can, well, what a thing that would be!

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.449
But right now in this silly century with these silly brains

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.900
We can only do our best, and that's gone pretty well so far.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.000
Brains that were really only designed for survival and mating later went on to discover the Higgs Boson and DNA

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.960
One day we might push it further and get to the stars,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.439
or whatever else is waiting out there.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.840
Boldly nudging the understanding line

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.740
Just a little further risk by risk, idea by idea.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.940
maybe until we've unmasked the whole of reality for what she really is.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.009
It won't be us who get to do that but our descendants

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.860
and it will only be possible because of all the humans who came before

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.020
because of us

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.420
And just as we stood on our ancestors shoulders to reach over our heads,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.860
they'll stand on ours and travel God knows where and discovered God knows what.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.480
It couldn't have been done without us,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.560
but it will be done without us.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.520
All of the research and thinking our species is doing today

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.720
will vitally contribute to whatever comes next to wherever we go next

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.040
To hopefully that day when there's no gap left between our models of the world and the world itself.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.379
When we push the understanding line to it's very limits and reality stops being weird sounds and flashing lights

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.230
and maybe makes itself known for what it really is.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.880
That will be cool.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.440
That will be a treat.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.500
One day.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.500
Maybe.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.800
Yeah, who's a good girl, huh?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.120
*mew*

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.040
[I will bite off your eyelids and wear them like a little fucking hat]

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.320
Wh- what?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320
*mew*

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.320
[I said isn't fish yummy yummy?]

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.810
oh

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.810
you
