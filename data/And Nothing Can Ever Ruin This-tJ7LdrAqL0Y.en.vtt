00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.820
You meet at a party

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.620
You're both young, probably late teens

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.860
You've both screwed other people

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.300
but it was all sort of, clumsy

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.780
You find excuses to hang out and pretend to be friends

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.320
She has a tiny birthmark on her neck that you notice but don't mention

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.100
You catch yourself thinking about her a little, then a lot, then all the time

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.880
You stop sleeping,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.480
and eating,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.140
and whatever music you're listening to at the time

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.020
will be so tied to her,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.000
that in 20 years,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.800
someone will play that song again and just for a second

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.600
you'll remember exactly how you feel now

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.740
And at some point, probably involving alcohol,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.240
you're going to take your clothes off together,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.180
and now you're really fucked

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.320
because she's under your skin

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.480
You had no idea,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.120
you can care about another human this much

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.060
And nothing can ever ruin this

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.820
And anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.740
You're not even 20 yet,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.100
but you just met the love of your life; how lucky is that?

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.060
You're probably neglecting time on your term papers,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.840
not getting much sleep but that doesn't matter

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.160
You get to know her parents well,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.300
and she gets to know yours too

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.360
and you've tried every sexual position under the sun

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.740
And sex is kinda comforting now,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.560
rather than something you think about doing all the time

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.580
You've got big plans

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.120
And nothing can ever ruin this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.880
She shows you new music you probably wouldn't have even given a shit about before

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.420
but somehow you quite like it now

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.380
You tell you about your shit and she pretends to care very convincingly

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.920
You move in together because,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.420
why not?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.280
You stay up late

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.020
You drink

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.840
You screw

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.600
You watch her sleeping in the morning sometimes

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.240
and suddenly all that bullshit love poetry they forced in you in school,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.400
begins to make sense

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840
You don't believe in fate or crap like that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.680
but you begin to understand why some people do

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.160
On one day she looks at someone else,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.020
and smiles

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.620
or laughs

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.820
and you feel this sort of weird sting in your brain

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.940
Welcome to jealously

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.060
It's quite natural

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.020
You don't mention it because you're not completely insane

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.040
She probably feels the same way about you,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.940
and that's nice

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.340
You both get jobs

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.300
You get stressed

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.160
You get tired

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.920
You watch a lot of TV together

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.000
You don't screw so often now but what did you expect?

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.400
You talk about getting a dog

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.600
She mentions some guy at work

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.920
who's been sending her funny emails

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.020
and you decide to murder him

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.660
but quickly remember that's illegal

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.260
You start go running in the afternoons

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.860
and you notice this girl that's usually this out around the same time

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.280
She's kinda pretty but

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.820
whatever

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.700
You spend less time together in the evening

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.660
You've forgotten what butterflies feel like

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.820
You mention this to a guy you know who's been married for years

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.120
and he tells you that's what happens

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.460
You've can't be loved out forever

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.600
This scares you a little

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.380
but it's alright because everything will be fine

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.820
And nothing can ruin this

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.820
You're in your 20's now and some of your school friends

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.340
are becoming architects or doctors and you're...

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.040
not

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.280
You wanted to be a...

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.780
whatever

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.300
but you've haven't practiced it in years

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.680
You start practicing again

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.940
or planning to build a business

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.140
or get a masters

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.080
She seems thoroughly unimpressed by the idea

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.120
She starts making baby jokes or

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.300
talking about buying a house

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.480
You don't really want the house

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.220
or a baby yet

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.660
because you're not that thing you wanted to be

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.660
And you're already 25 and 30 seems like a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.720
very big number that's getting scarily close

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.740
The sex is kinda routine now and you wonder if it's just a chore for her

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.580
You still hang out

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.240
and it's nice

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.820
but you begin to worry that something is missing

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.900
The two of you experiment with lingerie

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.820
and going for elaborate adventures

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.180
and that's fun for a while

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.900
You go running some more and you see that girl again in the woods

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.820
There's something sort of

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.920
otherworldly about her

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.920
She stops for breaths

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.800
so you do too

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.460
You say hello

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.660
She's smart

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.500
Kinda calls you on your bullshit

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.280
And you like that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.400
Then you carry on running,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.640
and push her out of your mind,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.700
but now you remember what butterflies feel like

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.920
You come home

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.940
You cook the same dish you had the night before,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.960
and the night before that

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.340
You talk about nothing much

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.320
She mentions that guy from work wants to meet you

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.400
And you reply that guy from work can suck a thousand dicks in hell

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.380
You sit in awkward silence for a while

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.140
and then you watch some more TV

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.020
And some more TV

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.720
And you live like this for another year

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.480
And that's fine

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.100
And nothing can ever ruin this

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.780
Ever

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.640
One of you screws someone else

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.020
or snaps for no reason

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.560
or mentions that you should take a break

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.460
or starts getting distant

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.940
or stops talking about the future

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.180
or whatever it is

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.480
Whether you were the one who broke it off or not,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.940
you're never going to wake up with her again or take her clothes off

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.640
or have anther screaming drunken argument about the European Union

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.220
or if dogs can look up or not

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.060
You go to bed

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.560
and suddenly the place smells of her in a way you've never noticed before

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.460
Music is shit

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.460
and food is shit

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.460
and everyone is shit however nice they are to you

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.060
And you know you've made a terrible mistake

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.260
Nothing can ruin this

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.120
and now everything is fucking ruined

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.280
You drink a lot of whiskey

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.460
You can't seem to sleep for more than a few hours

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.440
Someone mentions that she's been hanging out a lot with whatever his name is

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.180
You imagine them screwing briefly then go doing something else

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.540
You play a lot of video games

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.600
and discover that yes you do actually still have friends

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.100
and they've been patiently waiting for you for fucking years now

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.120
They listen to your bullshit politely because they've been through breakups too

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.000
They offer some nice little platitudes,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.300
plenty of more fish in the sea,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.800
etc

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.500
But you don't really believe them because they weren't really in love like you're in love

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.660
No one has been in love like you're in love

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.940
You and her send each other passive-aggressive texts

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.560
about getting your guitar back or whatever

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.060
And you meet up to swap your stuff over

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.440
It feels good to see her because you're over it now

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.280
And she has no power over you whatsoever

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.680
And you'll be moving on soon enough

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080
You screw

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.860
and literally a minute later realize what a dumb mistake that was

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.900
You carry on screwing for a while

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.040
You begin to think about getting back together

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.720
She makes a few bullshit digs at you

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.880
or you make some at her

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.020
And suddenly you stop thinking about getting it back together

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.600
You argue

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.380
You say horrible shit,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.980
the kind of stuff you imagine you won't say to your worst enemies

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.440
You play some more video games

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.780
You drink some more whiskey

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.400
You listen to some more Elliot Smith

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.740
Things are going well with a girl you met on the train

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.440
But you can't stomach the thought with sleeping with someone else

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.760
You briefly get into healthy eating

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.660
and having walks

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.160
and the benefits of keeping porn to a maximum of

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.960
17 one hour sessions a day

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.780
You keep practicing at that thing you love

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.440
You get pretty good at that thing you love

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.980
You remember what being human actually feels like

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.260
Someone tells you about a

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.600
sudden death in their family

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.180
and you realize you have absolutely nothing to feel sad about

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.200
Not really

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.300
Over time, people volunteer their own breakup stories

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.080
and some are far,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.160
far worse than yours

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.900
And again,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.520
you realize you have absolutely nothing to feel sad about

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.160
Not really

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.600
And subtly,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.340
so subtly you don't even notice

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.620
you become yourself again

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.000
And one day out of nowhere,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.620
that girl you met running invites you out

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.980
And you notice this little birthmark on her shoulder

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.880
but you don't mention it

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.860
And you stop sleeping,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.420
and eating,

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.120
and whatever music you're listening to at the moment will be so tied to her,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.200
that in 20 years,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.420
someone will play that song again

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.220
and just for a second,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.040
you'll remember exactly how you feel now

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.640
Music starts to sound good again

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.260
Food starts to taste good again

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.740
God what was all that about before?

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.020
Why were you being such a pussy?

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.820
Before long,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.520
the two of you are hanging out every other day

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.540
and you can't remember the last time you've felt so alive

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.460
Is this what you were meant to be doing all along?

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.880
Or maybe you're just repeating the same dumb pattern again

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.460
but god, it feels incredible

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.040
Maybe the whole thing is just some stupid gamble but you don't care

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.100
You didn't care last time

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.020
Because right now, you're sure of it

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.560
More sure than anything ever,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.300
and anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.520
But nothing can ever ruin this

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:21.100
And nothing can ever ruin this
