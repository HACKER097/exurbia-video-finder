00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.330
Oh look, it’s no aliens.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.910
No aliens there.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.249
No aliens there.

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:09.790
And just over here, a distinct lack of aliens.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.320
In any case there are three fairly good reasons
why they probably still haven’t said hello yet

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.320
yet.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.320
And they are as follows.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.920
The first is technology.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.930
Lots of scientists are searching the skies
for messages from aliens in the form of radio

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.930
waves.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.390
We've had radio waves for about a century.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.600
Our species has been around for about 1.5 million
years so that's about 0.005 % of how long

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.560
we’ve been on the planet or you know, this.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.560
Just here.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.140
Yeah, that’s you and.... your pathetic life.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.489
Radio is the best we've got at the moment,
but do you really want to bet it's the best

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.679
mode of communication we'll always have forever?

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:49.960
What if, in say, a thousand years, just here,
we discover another mode of communication?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.329
Imagine you're an ape living in the forest
and one day you decide there must be other,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.789
smarter apes out there so you start trying
to communicate with them.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.040
What would you do?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.410
Probably everything you know how to.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.410
Shout a bit.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.410
Throw shit.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.410
Give up.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680
Much like my recent experiences with the Bulgarian
immigration office.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.830
And all that time, you're going to be missing
the fact that there are smarter hairless apes

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.970
out there, billions of them, flying right
over you in big metal birds, and transmitting

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.720
magic waves straight through your body without
you ever knowing.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.720
Because, frankly, the idea is just too far
out for your little ape brain right now

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.110
So, we're about here, with technology we've
had for this long, and we're expecting all

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.680
aliens to be here too.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.270
In reality, if they've probably been around
for longer than we have, they might be here,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.060
using technology we can’t even imagine right
now.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.070
The second problem is smarts and it's even
harder to get around.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.530
Every time we send out a Hi?

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.500
Into the cosmos it assumes aliens would even
give a shit about talking to us in the first

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.500
place.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.560
We'd like to think they would.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.570
I mean look at all of our fascinating culture.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.780
Look at all of our noble accomplishments.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:12.349
Look at the wonderful feats we're capable
of. Look at all of the fantastic things we have to boast about.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.300
The thing is, and I've covered this one before
in a video about AI, how much of shit do we

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.549
give about species on our own planet less
intelligent than us?

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.280
We're certainly not trying to teach them how
to do calculus or play the accordion.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.280
Why?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.260
Because you're lovely, Charles Bonobo ape,
congratulations on evolving this far, Mr.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.099
Johnny Crow face, but you’re both going to suck
as a wingman.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.540
You don’t even have an alphabet or pornography
yet.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.349
No offense but evolve a bit then we’ll chat
yeah?

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.530
Likewise, if you're some smart arse alien
civilisation who has discovered antigravity

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.420
and hangover free alcohol, how much would you really
have to say to primitive warring monkeys who

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.579
still haven't even cracked immortality?

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.730
Sup.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.079
How's war and social media and still using
toilet paper working out for you?

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.939
Yeah, let's chat again when you’re not still
total idiots, eh?

00:02:58.939 --> 00:02:59.939
Ciao.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.409
And that's also ignoring the problem that
their brains might not even be wired remotely

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.670
like ours.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.709
If they have brains.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.870
Their language – if they have a language
– might be so difficult to speak – if

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.499
it's spoken – that we can't even reply – if
they write to us in the first place.

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.239
Just look at the diversity of life on Earth.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.700
Anyone speak dolphin?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.700
No?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.260
I’ve got a GCSE in Spanish if that helps.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.739
That's the second problem, intelligence, and
it relies on us finding other species who

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.950
are at almost exactly the same point in development
as us.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.450
That is, slightly above flinging our own faeces,
but still trying to blow each other up.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.290
The final problem, my personal favourite,
is extinction and this is kind of the one

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.290
to worry about.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.010
One answer to: if the universe is so big,
where be aliens though?

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.069
Is, well...

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.250
70 years ago or so we discovered nuclear weapons.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.900
There are now around 15,000 warheads on the
planet, capable of obliterating life a few

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.900
times over.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.279
This has happened in 7 decades.

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:59.329
In the entire history of technology we went
from a bit mouthy but most harmless to could

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.909
wipe themselves and everything else out in
just under an hour . And that's just one technology

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:04.909
we've discovered.

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.650
Do you wanna bet we're not going to find more?

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.989
Doesn't even have to be weaponry.

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.670
There might be something built into physics
for example where species accidentally create

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.180
black holes or some other deadly event, or
incurable superbugs, or that giant Yellowstone

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.220
tit thing going off, not to forget all the
methane under the ocean, solar flares that

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.510
could roast our entire civilisations with
only a few minutes warning, or just another

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.360
asteroid like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs
or just anything along those lines.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.570
If other species are out there, they’re
probably facing, or have faced, the same threats.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.449
It might be that only 1% of civilisations
get through that window and evolve into peace-loving-tech-monkeys

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:52.580
at the other end.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.340
Or it might be 0% explaining why no one's
out there returning our calls.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.360
So, that's the happy haps.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.509
Where be aliens?

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.800
Probably dead/too evolved/too
far away/busy playing civ 6.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.300
Steam handle exurb1a by the way.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.990
Because to even get a reply back we might
need to be at exactly the right point in technological

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.241
development, sending messages that actually
appear smart enough, to civilisations who

00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:18.650
haven't already fucking wiped themselves out.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.550
If it makes you feel any better, keep in mind
we’re the smartest, most intellectual, sophisticated,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:30.990
and sentient, creatures we’ve found in the
entire universe so far.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.800
Then again you also began life as an orgasm

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800
Stay humble

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:52.870
Bye.
