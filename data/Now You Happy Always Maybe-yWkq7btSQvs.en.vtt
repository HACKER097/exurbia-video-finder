00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:39.089
Job and tired and stress and bed and alarm at 6:30 tomorrow and your boss big cock juggler and your co-workers

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.090
Also cock jugglers and rent high, and no more lunch time bongs or chill. Happy sometimes,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.779
but not happy always. So, how happy always?

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.390
Maybe if nice girlfriend or boyfriend.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.349
Then you with nice girlfriend or boyfriend much parks and ice cream together and movies and saucy stuff

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:59.219

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.589
and he hygiene not much or she bit shouty and now you just happy sometimes again.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.919
Not happy always, so how happy always?

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.499
Maybe pancakes maybe more cowbell maybe mystery chemicals on Dark Web

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.049
Yes? No, still only happy sometimes. Maybe lots of magic paper?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.900
Yes.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.439
Many hours at job, then better position

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.119
etc etc much respect but very tired very stressed even with lots of magic paper. So dream partner with

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.078
saucy stuff, much park, much ice cream, lunchtime bongs galore, lots of magic paper, still not happy always.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.519
What now? Maybe babies? Only 20 years as parents much happy yes?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.449
Definitely, not happy always, but fine. Then children

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.149
happy always then they teenagers then adults then they also only happy sometimes

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.038
Hmm. Much time. You very old now. No more job, you with grandchildren, and slippers and many biscuits

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.110
You healthy yes, everything easy yes, but still only happy sometimes. Aaayyy. How happy always?

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.060
Maybe never. Maybe this not for happy always. This, for clevers and food and babies lots

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.309
because evolution. Why?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.649
Because if happy always your ancestors, no fire no house

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.489
No civilization, just but ba ba ba lovely wilderness today mm-hmm. Then dead. No technology

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.179
No, Einstein no Mia Khalifa. No lunch time bongs

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.149
Yes, and Ancestors who always happy not good at alive, so they dead before kinky stuff

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.739
so you not from those ancestors. YOU,  from millions of other clever humans who happy sometimes but not always and

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.829
If humans only happy sometimes then humans good at advancement. One day human sad,

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.909
so maybe suddenly clothes maybe compass maybe engineering, maybe trade empires, maybe elaborate saucy stuff

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.640
Maybe Particle Colliders and sometime later, maybe maybe human galactic civilization

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.309
maybe new horizons in science, maybe lovely cuddly utopia etc etc.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.429
And that thanks to human brain that sometimes,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.029
but not always, happy. Humans half decent species. One day maybe all because evolution

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.690
occasional massive arse. So happy sometimes good

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.310
Yes, well, no.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.459
But not bad. Happy sometimes okay. Earth

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.589
lovely, existence interesting, ice cream, hugs, parks, lunchtime bonds. Life alright. Life not so bad. Everything cool.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.590
Maybe. Bye.
