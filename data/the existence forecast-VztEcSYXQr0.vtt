earth

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.880
0.0041 inches the sun will now have used

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.399
51 trillion 840 million tons of hydrogen

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.680
in the last 24 hours at a rate of 600

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.060
million tons a second with only one one

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.459
billionth of that energy actually

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.739
reaching the Earth on Neptune we expect

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.800
temperatures of minus 225 degrees

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.560

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.540
hour on Jupiter the great red spots an

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.280
anti-cyclonic Vortex will continue to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.980
rage as it has done for the last four

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.920
Centuries with wind speeds of 270 miles

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.459
an hour on Mercury nothing will happen

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.620
on Enceladus nothing will happen 3.7

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.319
billion miles from the Sun Pluto will

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.660
remain Frozen Barren and dead from the

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.180
100 000 galaxies of our Galactic

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.860
supercluster laniacaya we expect a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.200
continued and total absence of messages

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.360
suggesting intelligence confirming we

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.459
are entirely alone with the speed of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.260
light rendering any and all other solar

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.940
systems impossibly distant and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.459
inaccessible and in the observable

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.620
universe at least

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.620
270 million stars will die today

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.620
tomorrow morning we expect the world to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.620
be composed of 80 quindicilian molecules

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.060
or an 80 followed by 48 zeros and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.099
that'll probably go on through to the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.480
evening Earth's core will remain stable

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.459
at a temperature of five and a half

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.920
thousand degrees producing a magnetic

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.700
field of about 50 microteslas in the Rio

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.459

Antarctica a family of emperor penguins

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.680
will be taking the day off to enjoy each

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.260
other's company in the human Kingdom sex

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.879
is likely to occur at least 120 million

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.379
times across the Earth tomorrow and

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.780
thanks to a year of mutual shyness

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.580
coming to an end 119 million of those

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.739
instances will be courtesy of a new

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.140
couple in Portugal one hundred thousand

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.360

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.940
birthday and 700 million children will

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.500
be attending school adjusting for life

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.260
expectancy and a growing population

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.360
tomorrow 300 000 humans will be

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.220
experiencing the best day of their lives

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.680
2 billion cups of coffee will be

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.599
consumed followed by 500 million liters

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.500
of beer 40 million liters of ice cream

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:13.019
and 130 000 bottles of Tabasco at 11 52

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.760
am Guido Marconi aged four and a half

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.500
will be making his first attempt at

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.760
imagining a color that doesn't exist yet

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.620
at 1 29 PM Philip Novak aged 51 will be

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.300
emptying his attic and find a childhood

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.020
toy his father gave him when he was

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.940
little at 207 PM Antonio Novak aged 86

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.380
will receive an email from his son after

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.300
10 years of Silence between them

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.340
speaking of forgiveness and asking if

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.320
they can reunite the streets of Warsaw

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.479
will vibrate with an old man's cheering

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.759
for exactly 23 and one-quarter seconds

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.880
tomorrow global life expectancy will

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.220
increase by 73 days and 126 000 people

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.020
will be lifted out of poverty by evening

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.300
3 000 books will have been published

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.580
four thousand new inventions patented 12

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.340
billion phone calls made and 300 billion

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.720
emails sent 250 miles overhead the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.479
International Space Station will be

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.919
making 16 orbits of the earth 240 000

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.380
miles away the lunar reconnaissance

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.479
Orbiter will be mapping out the Moon 140

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.400
million miles away on Mars the Curiosity

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.560
Rover will bravely continue exploring

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.300
Gale crater and in interstellar space

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.919
the Voyager probes will travel another

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.020
million miles from the earth with

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.479
greetings intended for alien ears for

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.880
the next 1 billion years tomorrow in our

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.740
galaxy a new star will be born in the

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.479
local galaxies several hundred million

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.520
more will be enjoying their first day of

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.780
existence The Pillars of Creation will

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.639
continue to fluoresce in the Eagle

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.199
Nebula and for the next three million

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.479
years the black hole at the heart of our

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.639
galaxy will remain a safe 27 000 light

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.080
years distant it is quite possible that

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.000
somewhere amid the quintillions of

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.620
planets of the cosmos new life will

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.780
begin it is quite possible that

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.940
somewhere life will be searching for us

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.560
further out into creation dark matter

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.300
will continue to matter the Hubble

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.860
constants remaining constant the speed

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.840
of light remaining fixed in the vacuum

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.780
the laws of nature remaining utterly

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.780
mysterious omnipotent and absolutes from

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.699
tomorrow until the end of Eternity as in

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.940
Iceland we'll be expecting highs of 4

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.780
degrees humidity of 75 and not even the

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.580
slimmest

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.560
ounce in of finding out what our

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.560
purpose is down here on the planet

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.259
and now the sport
