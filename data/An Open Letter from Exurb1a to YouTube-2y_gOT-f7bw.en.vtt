Hi, Youtube just a quick note from a relatively small channel. Couldn't help notice you've started punishing content creators by restricting advertising on anything that

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.189
Might be Vulgar or sexually suggestive. Just wanted to say it's about time and channels making content like that can suck a dick

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.509
The only reason YouTube got so big was because it was television, but without the censorship

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.680
It seems like a great idea to now turn the [platform] into a safe advertising space free of anything outrageous like humor wit

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.600
Controversy or fun hopefully you can drive all the big creators away by Christmas, anyway

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.680
I'm off to start shooting a makeup tutorial shit balls horse minge. Love and kisses xavier
