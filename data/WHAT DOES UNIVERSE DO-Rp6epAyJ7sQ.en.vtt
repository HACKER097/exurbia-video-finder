00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
What does universe do?

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.960
Well, here's some stuff what we thought what universe does so far:

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.015
1) Zoo for humans made by Yahweh.
Five out of ten.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.600
2) No universe, just me. This is called solipsism and shut up.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.500
One out of ten.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.980
3) Zoo for humans made by Shiva.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.760
This is number one in disguise, but she is considerably more attractive than Yahweh

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.260
and has bazongas, so: six out of ten.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.960
4) It just is. Stop assuming stuff has meaning.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.020
More rational approach. Eight out of ten.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.680
5) One out of ten. Lack of imagination.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800
Yes, but what does universe really do?

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.950
Well, the universe expands very fast, 13 billion years ago, and slowly loses heat,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.800
eventually spreads out until there aren't any stars or nebulas left, and we're watching it wind down.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.920
The universe is a big wind down machine.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.600
Nine out of ten. Excellent, based on empirical evidence.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.980
Or, the universe is a complexity machine.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.170
Atoms build into molecules, which build into planets, and then DNA and organisms,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.540
and swans, and sea cows, and yes,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.220
very clever carbon units that make stuff with their opposable thumbs,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.460
walk around on two legs and maybe, just maybe, they make more complex stuff than them,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.360
like computers that are conscious, and...

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.220
don't die of pneumonia, or cancer, or E. coli, or anything silly, and...

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.900
those machines make stuff that are more complex than they are, and so on, and so on, and so on, and...

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.600
The universe isn't running down, that's just a byproduct.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.780
The Universe is speeding up.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.040
It took billions of years to make an Earth, and only took a few million to make a human,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.180
and then only 20,000 to make a human that didn't have to hunt all the time,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.060
and then only a few thousand years for radio, and then fifty for television, and thirty for the internet.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.800
Yes, we're small, and space is very, very big -- but ultimately it doesn't matter which telescope you look up.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.940
The most complex thing we've ever seen the universe make is looking up that telescope.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.520
The universe isn't wearing out or dying -- it's waking up.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.460
It's evolving more and more complex patterns and more and more complex shapes,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.800
and you are the most complex thing it's ever done that we know of.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.160
So next time you're feeling glum, keep in mind your brain is the fucking icing on the universe cake, yeah?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.340
And it took 13 billion years to make that cake, yeah?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.640
And it was very hard to pull off,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480
and there were a number of complicated instructions to follow -- but here you are,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.780
for about 80 years or so, living in the most exciting time in human history that's ever happened,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.560
so just shut up! Just shut up!
