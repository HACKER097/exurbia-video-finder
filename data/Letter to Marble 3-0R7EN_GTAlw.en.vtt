00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.780
To our excellent friends of Marble 3:

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.180
Congratulations on decoding this message from the cosmic microwave background radiation.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.620
You must be getting very clever.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.800
Don't ask why it's written in your languages –

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.860
give us some credit.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.820
We're gone now, but we've left this message behind for when you're ready to hear it.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.280
There are 6 more messages hidden here and there,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.320
under things and over things in the universe,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.840
and you'll find them when you're a little smarter and wiser than today.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.760
None of the messages contain any recipes for technology.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.180
This is just an invitation – to you and your descendants.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.780
So, first, a little about ourselves.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.920
We hail from a very distant place and a very distant time.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.360
We do not have tentacles. Our skin is not green.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
We have passed through the many stages of planetary ascendance,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.400
and we're off now, on our next adventure.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.100
But before we go, there are a few things we would like to convey to you –

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.680
our excellent friends of Marble 3.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.040
Hi, how's it going? How's the weather?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.420
Presumably, you now have agriculture and civilization, yes?

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.520
How's that working out? Is everybody well-fed?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.820
If not, why not?

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.380
Are you held hostage to weapons you built yourself?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.860
If so... Why?

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.340
Don't feel so special. Biology differs from marble to marble, but the squabbles are always the same:

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.140
"Hey, give my toy back".
"No!"
*Thump*

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.440
A very long time from now you'll realize you had the materials to build heaven all along –

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.780
you just lacked the blueprint, and if we gave it to you now, you would only build hell.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.740
You'll work it out.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.760
We predict you have simple spacecraft –

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.780
congratulations.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.000
We predict you have simple doomsday weapons –

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
commiserations.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.780
We predict you're not yet clever enough to realize just how silly you are.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.180
Such is it always with teenagers...

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.720
Perhaps you've had a good look around to the black, and noticed just how quiet it is out there.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.560
You're probably flirting with the idea you're alone in space.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.840
Don't be so rash.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.920
What does an insect on your marble know about your cities?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.940
What do you think you know about the universe?

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.980
Baby steps.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.120
And just as some insects climb great towers and look up,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.040
recently you've discovered the true scale of things – or, let's say, some of it.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.360
Maybe you've wondered: "How is it possible the world is so big and so indifferent?"

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.160
It's neither – but again, baby steps.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.480
Feel free to grow into the galaxy when you're ready.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.840
We've left a few treats here and there along the way.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.000
When you claim your thousandth sun – think back to your first,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.120
and how you once believed it was alive.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.240
Don't be so sure some of the others aren't.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.700
And please, avoid living near the big red ones – it's way more hassle than it's worth.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.480
Have you found the great black at the bottom of everything?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.880
In return for the powers of adulthood, one surrenders the comforts of infancy.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.000
Maybe that seems like a curse, but it's a blessing, really.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.840
You control your own destiny now.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.620
You always did, anyway.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.880
You will watch sunsets on distant worlds,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.180
you will construct a few suns of your own.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.320
You will learn to hear the music of the spheres,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.360
and one day to play it yourself.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.440
You will gain access to tremendous energies,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.560
you will be denied access to some of your wildest scientific fantasies.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.660
Nature's imagination is better than yours, and she is under no obligation to make herself comprehensible.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.040
As a rule, the great extinctions of other civilisations have not been due to cosmic events,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.160
but the civilizations themselves.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.520
You might only be a teenager, but many of your planetary cousins died much earlier still,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.000
and many never even achieved your simple level of sophistication.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.220
There are seven stages of planetary transition, as far as we know.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.480
You are currently passing through stage 2.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.600
Stage 2 is one of the most deadly.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.640
You are waking up to your technological capabilities – transformative and destructive;

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.680
you have dared to position yourself as the smartest thing that ever was – and, naturally, that scares you.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.600
As your development continues, you will discover deadlier and deadlier weapons.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.080
You will attempt to fix the world, and break it horribly many times.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.640
You will wander blindly into the universe's libraries –

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.460
all hubris, all certainty –

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.840
and barely be out the door before you realize you didn't understand a damn thing you read.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.560
We were young once, too.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.720
We ran about turning every rock over, and before we'd even seen what was underneath, we were already picking the rocks up and bashing each other with them.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.740
But at some point we all sat down together to just admire the beach.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.480
Every civilization is entirely unique.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.520
You are the only marble with you on it.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.100
And if you blow the whole thing to hell now, a thing like you will never happen again

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.760
for all of time and back.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.620
If you succeed, you will do it alone, and one day you'll be proud of that.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.900
You're going to have to explore the jungles map-less.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.680
You're gonna have to guard your own crib and wipe your own tears.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.020
There are only a handful of ways to save the world.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.080
There are a trillion ways to end it.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.060
Our history is very different to yours, but our futures aren't so dissimilar.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.180
We can no more explain the true shape of things to you than you could explain algebra to one of your animal friends,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.520
but just know that if everything goes well, a long time from now

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.780
you will stop at the top of the hill for lunch and look back down at how far you've come,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.440
and it WILL have been worth it.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.440
This has been an invitation.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.020
We know you won't make it to the party for a long time yet,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.480
but when you do, it will be an honor to welcome you into the warm.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.000
And the next adventure we'll embark on together:

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.800
as friends, as equals,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.960
as cousins with the universe in common,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.680
bound for the open road.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.360
Be proud: you've come such a long way.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.400
Be careful: there is so much further to go.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.160
Until we speak again, then – far from here, and long from now.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.780
To our excellent friends of Marble 3.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.340
With love, and admiration, and the best wishes on your long journey.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.560
We'll see you when you get here.
