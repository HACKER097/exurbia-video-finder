00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Joblivion (noun)

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.020
The endless process of going to interview you hate for careers you don't want.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.540
Interviewer: So, tell me a bit about yourself.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.300
You: I am a people person.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.480
Interviewer: And how do you think you will benefit the company?

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.300
You: I aM a PeOpLe PeRsOn﻿.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.340
Interviewer: I see, and tell me exactly why you would like to work for

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.500
Macgyver's Shit Sandwiches, Sandwiches Made of Authentic Human Shit.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.800
You: [Deep beath] Well,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.680
FXCK!!!!!!!

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.580
Life Envy

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.720
Bumping into someone from school and ask them what they do now.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.420
And they say something like:" I am an architect, or a doctor,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.900
or I can actually tie my shoelaces etc.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.140
And they ask you what you do now.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.320
And you spontaneously claim to be an astronaut,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.080
or the Queen's personal funk advisor.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.320
But what you've really been doing in the last three years is

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.420
Sitting in a dark room,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.340
and crying,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.420
and eating pies.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.340
or take time to be 'ALIVE'.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.480
Beer-vana

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.440
A sudden certainty after drinking large quantities of alcohol that you CAN fix your life.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.500
And all you need to do is

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.280
Learn the guitar,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.360
or buy a cattery,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.240
and STOP flushing letters from the debt collection agency down the toilet without reading them.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.980
Come on! Grow up!

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.520
JUST BUY

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.360
A FXCKIN' SHREDDER!

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.400
Dip- pression

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.900
The sudden and overwhelming conviction that there is NO caramel core to life.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.240
And you'll probably spending your rest of days in a state of quiet confusion.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.320
Then again,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.220
you've got loads of unopened pots of hot sauce in the fridge more than those take-away pizzas.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.660
So things are looking up, baby!  (/≧▽≦)/

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.720
Rupert

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.700
This is a small creature who is invisible,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.455
and starts whispering stuffs in your brain somewhere around the age of twenty-five.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.360
Helpful comments to the effect of

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.780
"Aaaa, video game and pornography again.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.320
Another successful Wednesday!

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.340
Dad is gonna be

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.020
REAL PROUD NOW!!!"

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.280
Grimsomnia

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.240
The nighty ritual of trying to sleep.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.080
Just when you're about to thrift off, you suddenly recall every embarrassing thing you even did in high resolution.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.860
Brain:" Hey!

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.920
I know you're tired, but remember when you wrote out that

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.180
short but anatomically specific rant about checking yourself for testicular lumps,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.760
but you've opened the wrong window on your phone,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.000
AND ACCIDENTALLY SEND IT TO YOUR ELDLY PIANO TEACHER?"

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.680
"Haha, good times!

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.660
It'S fiNe, sLEep nOw!

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.360
Survival of the Shittest

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.440
This is the principal that every time you look up bellends from high school,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.100
you will inevitably find that they are now exceptionally rich and living fulfilling lives

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.160
and you will feel nothing but boundless good will towards them.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.840
THE TOTAL CUN-

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.200
Nihilism Gatherings

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.820
A few years ago you would've called these

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.820
"Parties"

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.180
But now they consist people you age gathering in a room

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.740
and attempting to look at you while they consume titanic volumes of alcohol

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.160
Occasionally, one of them will lean over you and whisper:

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.200
"D‘you know what the fckck you're doing with your life?"

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.160
And you reply:

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.120
"Not a clue."

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.080
And you both pretend that didn't happened.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.260
The Professor

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.600
This will be someone at the party who has read at least half a Wikipedia article on the chosen subjects

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.580
and will insist on hijacking said party
 to bang on about it.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.680
And by golly, I hope you are interested
 in the miracle of Kombucha,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.780
or the revolutionary tactics
 of Napoleonic military strategy.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.020
because that's all you'll be FUCKING listening to now

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.300
The Great Decline

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.606
The nearer thirty gets,

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:48.380
the more it becomes apparent that your teenage body wasn't actually the default setting.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.900
That was a temporary super power.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.140
And now, for some reason,

00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:54.120
pounding Schnitzerling chocolate cake 
will actually lead to weight gain

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.680
and trying to recreate the five day parties of yesteryear

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.780
may will threaten a cheeky touch of sudden death.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.520
That's Very Interesting

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.220
A phrase you will catch yourself saying just over 14 thousand times a day,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.140
since you're now over the age when telling people to fuck off will get you ostracized or fired

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.540
Suburban Gourmet

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.640
A unique brand of cooking you will developed from the comfort of your own kitchen, including:

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.400
A wrap with crisp in it,

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.900
Pot Noodle à l'orange,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.100
and for dessert,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.400
why not Half an oreo you found behind the fridge?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.460
And maybe a spot of hysterical crying.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.740
Uhhhehhhehheh

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.760
A noise that could mean yes or no

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.880
that you will make frequently in response to questions that you should know the answer to

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.020
but you are now too old to admit to not knowing.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.040
So, what's your pension situation?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.540
Uhhhehhhehheh

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.260
And what actually is a raisin?

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.000
Uhhhehhhehheh

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.420
And, how have you managed to live in your overdraft for the last twelve years now?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.000
Uhhheh...hheh.......heh

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.040
The Five Stages of Aging Grief

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.020
1. Denial

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.600
I'm not turning thirty.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.380
2. Anger

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.120
There is NO WAY I'm turning thirty! (╯&gt;д&lt;)╯⁽˙³˙⁾

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.040
3. Bargaining

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.760
God? You listening? _(:з」∠)_

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.220
If you stop this from happening,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.280
I'll stop writing love letters to Richard Dokins

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280
and maybe entertain the idea that you actually exist.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.140
4. Depression

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.580
Sometimes when you look into your thirties, your thirties is looking to you

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.320
And finally concluding in,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.060
5. Denial (again)

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.800
FUCK THIS! I'm moving to Canada!

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.140
Emigration Threats

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.440
In occasion fantasy you have on a bus 
that if things get really bad,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.680
well, you'll just move to Canada.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.760
Because you could almost count 
to three in French

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.900
and you kinda always want to go to a
 Maple syrup bar with an elk.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.020
The Rage Gaze

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.080
When you meet someone in their 
thirties, forties, or above,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.120
and you bang on how old you are 
about to get in twenty-eight etc.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.700
And they silently fix you with a stare that says:

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.440
"I would sell my eyeballs on Ebay to be
 as young as you again,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.280
your ungrateful little shit muffin."

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.100
Glud

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.760
or

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.600
General look of underlying despair

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.000
which is a smile you can wear at all hours of the day

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.420
to signal that you've died inside several years ago now

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.580
but the rot hasn't quite reach your outer body yet.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.580
And finally, Chucklet.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.400
This is when your mother phones up 
to see about how everything is going,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.340
and you know she desperately want to hear you say:

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.020
"Well, I'm finally settling down and I've decided 
to join society as a functional human being."

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.300
And instead you say:

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.920
"Yeah, I've been working on a poorly-constructed Youtube video

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.880
about words you might need to know in your twenties,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.880
and I spend most of weekends trying to play trumpet with my bottom."

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.880
And she makes a small noise that sounds like

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.020
Uhhhehhhehheh

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.660
and mentions that maybe she will call back again next year

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.600
Mom: "Also don't forget that you've on
 the planet almost three decades now

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.220
and achieve literally nothing of worth.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.420
Speak soon then! :)"

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:37.200
[Music, the good happy one]
