00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
July 1969,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.180
you're probably an ex-test pilot with a Boy Scout badge for spitting in the face of death,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.040
and on that day you find yourself at Kennedy Space Center,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.340
wearing a spacesuit and about to board a strange machine.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.920
The machine is called "the Saturn 5 rocket", and is about three blue whales high,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.340
weighs about as much as thirty-five 737s,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.500
and very shortly, a million liters of liquid oxygen are going to mix with 700,000 liters of kerosene,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.460
and the machine is gonna go *brrrr*,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.560
and quite possibly KILL YOU DEAD!

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.360
So you hop in with your two other mates, strap up,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.220
and try to ignore the fact that you're about to ride the explosive equivalent of 400 tons of TNT up into the sky

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.860
on the back of seven and a half million pounds of thrust.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.740
And sure enough, a system of valves open below you, mixing the liquid oxygen and kerosene, and are ignited.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.280
The cabin rocks left to right with the guidance computer gimballing the five gigantic F-1 engines 300 feet below you,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.000
desperately trying to stop you smashing into the launch tower.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.280
You are squashed back into your seat four times your normal weight.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.220
By 9:35 AM you're 42 miles high, riding 5% for America's federal budget into the morning sky.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.260
By 9:44 AM, the first two stages of the rocket are jettisoned, and you're 118 miles high.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.980
By 12:22 PM you're in orbit, going at 24,000 miles an hour –

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.400
or, if you prefer, speeding around the Earth at about 17 times faster than a bullet.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.860
By 12:49, you get the word you'll go for trans-lunar injection.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.620
A few minutes of engine burn later, and you're now headed out of Earth orbit.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.700
You blow the bolts connecting the two sections of your rocket ship, separating your module from the lunar module,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.040
spin them around and dock again.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.320
The Earth begins to recede behind you.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.440
By 2:45 PM, you are now riding 26 tons of food, instruments, and science at about 25,000 miles an hour.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.760
You are the commander of Apollo 11.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.420
And while two NASA missions have orbited the Moon already,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.460
yours will now attempt to be the first to land and stand on that alien world.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.900
Fun fact: peeing in zero gravity is a nightmare.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.040
To counteract this, since all Apollo astronauts were men,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.720
engineers developed a system whereby one would urinate into a condom attached to a hose.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.580
The condom sizes came in "small", "medium", and "large".

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.980
Legend has it that some astronauts were choosing the large size based on pride,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.620
and some were making a mess because it wasn't the right size.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.140
Allegedly, NASA opted to rename the sizes

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.100
"extra-large",

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.840
"immense",

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.340
and "unbelievable".

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.140
*Genuine giggle*

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.100
Yeah! Space exploration!

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.860
Anyway, what is this big white thing you're flying towards? Where did it come from?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.700
Well, no one knows for sure yet.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.880
The leading theory is that about four billion years ago something about the size of Mars – a planet we've called Theia –

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.260
hit the Earth, and bits of the Earth came off, and eventually collected together into old Moonface McGee herself.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.000
She's about 81 times lighter than the Earth, about ⅓ the diameter –

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.180
bigger than Pluto, by the way, but most things are –

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.780
and her gravity is around ⅙ ours.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.520
It takes the Moon 27 days to orbit us properly,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.200
but it also takes the Moon 27 days to turn once on her axis,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.380
which means we only ever see one side of the Moon.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.300
The reason the moon looks different to us through the month is her position relative to the Sun.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.320
As she swings around us, she's either between us and the Sun, called "new moon",

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.760
waxes into the first quarter, then full,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.520
wanes into third quarter, and back to new.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.720
And moons in our solar system aren't unique at all:

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.580
Mars has 2, Neptune has 14, Saturn has 82,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.580
but we are the only planet in our solar system with one moon, weirdly,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.360
and she is by far the largest, relative to her planet.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.160
No good explanation for any of that yet, but boy, are we glad she's here!

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.720
She kindly regulates the tides and stops us wobbling on our axis.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.180
All in all, very pretty, very mysterious,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.560
And would you look at that – you're almost there.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.100
Well, about 33,000 miles away, but you've entered the Moon's sphere of influence.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.000
That means the Moon has more gravitational power over you than the Earth does.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Shoes off! Best behavior, please!

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.480
You're in her house now.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.560
Out the window and below is a barren expanse, a visual history of great violence:

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.440
craters where comets hit, some as wide as 175 kilometers in diameter.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.240
one astronaut stays in the command module, while you and your colleague transfer to the lunar module.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.920
And before you know it, you're separated and descending to the surface.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.360
Ancient and dead volcanoes have covered the Moon in 23 of what our ancestors mistook for "maria" –

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.180
Latin for "seas", as we still call them today.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.440
the Sea of Crises, the Eastern Sea,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.440
and there, our destination –

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.080
the Sea of Tranquility.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.560
But you're traveling too fast for some reason, and overshooting the landing spot.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.000
Still, you've come all this way, and you'll be damned if you quit here.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.780
6,000 feet above now, alarms go off: 1201 and 1202.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.160
No one back on Earth is sure what that even means, but they advise you to carry on with the descent.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.000
Beside you, your co-pilot calls out the altitude.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.780
you're now coming down on the southwestern edge of the Sea of Tranquility,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.420
but there are boulders the size of trucks everywhere – no sign of flat. You can't land here.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.160
You take over manual control, desperately looking for a smooth area to set down,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.340
the biometric sensors reading your heart rate at 156 beats per minute.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.900
700 feet, 400 feet, fuel is dribbling away.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.940
If you can't find a safe spot, you have to abort the entire mission.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.720
150 feet, 75 dropping still,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.220
then a dust cloud kicks up beneath you –

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.100
five feet,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.840
two,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.820
one and a half,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.700
one,

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.020
and your co-pilot calls contact light,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.520
and with a jolt and only 15 seconds of fuel left...

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.880
You're down.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.220
And you say...

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.420
"Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.140
The schedule calls for the two of you to sleep,

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.660
but you're the first humans to visit the Moon, for God's sake.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.760
During this time, your co-pilot takes Holy Communion, though does it on the quiet:

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.200
NASA is currently engaged in a lawsuit with an atheist who had objections to a previous mission orbiting the Moon,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.260
and reading from the Bible as it did so.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.560
Then, at 2:39 AM, you open the hatch and slowly descend the ladder.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.640
You pull a lever, activating the camera already on the outside of the lunar module to witness what is about to come next.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.920
You reach the bottom of the ladder, still standing on the leg now.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.360
You observe the surface of the Moon is granular, almost like powder.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.180
You uncover a plaque on the lunar module, saying:

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.660
"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969, A.D.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.420
We came in peace for all mankind."

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.100
Tentatively, you step back with your left foot onto the first celestial body humankind has ever visited.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.200
And having been allowed to choose those first words on a new world, you say:

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.040
"That's one small step for _a_ man, one giant leap for mankind."

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.660
Which will later be misquoted repeatedly without the indefinite article, as "One small step for man",

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.700
Which makes no sense, if you think about it, because that would mean "one small step for Humanity, one giant leap for Humanity",

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.800
but whatever – you're on the Moon.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.520
Your colleague exits the lunar module, pausing on the ladder a few moments to become the first human ever to urinate while outside on the Moon,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.660
then joins you on the surface.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.520
You erect a United States flag and accept a call directly from your then-president Richard Nixon.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.300
The two of you experiment with transport methods, including kangaroo hops,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.260
you set up scientific equipment, you take photos, collect ground samples...

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.700
But this picnic runs on oxygen.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.760
So, two and a half hours later after setting foot down here,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.640
the two of you climb the ladder again, and return to the lunar module, and attempt to sleep.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.380
You sleep – not very well, but... a little.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.540
It's time now to go home.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.780
You're both relying on a single ascent engine that can only be fired once, meaning one chance to leave.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.920
Your colleague has somehow damaged the circuit breaker for the engine in the course of moving about.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.120
You jam a felt-tip pen in there, hoping that –

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.140
h-hoping –

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.320
your third colleague will be flying overhead shortly, waiting to rendezvous if all goes well.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.140
The ascent engine is fired, everything goes fine.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.540
At ⅙ Earth's gravity, making it into orbit is a doddle.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.640
your colleague catches you in orbit perfectly, and you're reunited.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.520
A burn to leave lunar orbit, and you're on your way –

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.260
back home to praise, and awards, and another Boy Scout badge for not only spitting in the face of death,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.360
but kicking him right in the disco stick too,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.160
and curiously, several hours later on the television sets of the world,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.880
people, American and non-American, will say: "we did it".

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.940
"WE did it".

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.020
As if that plaque left on the surface rings true already:

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.220
"WE came in peace for all mankind".

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.500
And during your three-day journey back to Earth,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.240
perhaps you wonder when we'll come back to the Moon.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.620
In four months, actually,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.280
then five months later, but that doesn't go so well...

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.520
Nine months later, that time goes fine;

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.580
six months later,

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.500
nine months, and then the last mission eight months later.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.420
And as much as it might surprise you to hear,

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.820
for the next half century humans will never leave Earth orbit again.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.820
Oh, there'll be shuttles, and space stations, horrific disasters, collaboration –

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.180
but all from the tether of Earth's gravity.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.800
For us in the future, though, things might finally be about to change.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.400
Firstly, NASA have committed themselves to returning to the moon with humans by 2024 as of today,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.080
and they've been busy bees, designing the Space Launch System to launch in 2021.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.120
It could get us back to the Moon, EASY.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.620
But now we have commercial projects taking off: SpaceX, Blue Origin, Boeing –

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.280
all of them vying to get us back on the lunar surface.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.960
Things. Are. Occurring!

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.700
Obviously, going back to the Moon for science is attractive,

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.260
but science probably won't be enough to keep us there,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.580
because cha-ching-ching, etc.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.140
There are plenty of resources for mining on the Moon:

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.080
gold, platinum, yadda-yadda,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.600
and, rather more unique, helium-3 – an isotope useful for nuclear fusion.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.340
But the real dog's gonads to go back for is more spacing.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.200
The moon would be a perfect base of operations for,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.020
AH: serving as a practice ground for learning how to live in hostile places

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.060
for when we go to certain other planets soon –

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.080
which we will –

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.200
and BUH: fueling up and maintaining vehicles leaving Earth on their way beyond to other spots in the Solar System –

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.080
when we go,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.220
which we will!

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.600
Also, we could build mass drivers to shoot objects elsewhere with no need for propellant,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.120
establish farms, schools, administration...

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.060
Buzz Aldrin took a wee on the Moon first day, whatever...

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.820
But, a beginning. A point of departure to the rest of the Solar System.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.400
And one day – long from now, but one day –

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.920
beyond the Solar System, too. Perhaps.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.300
If this is what you wake up to every morning,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.540
if this is the view from your lunar window,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.840
how would you feel about our petty squabbles back on Earth?

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.660
No astronaut has ever returned from space and said:

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.460
"Yeah, the universe was alright...

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.200
Not as good as a nice fight though, eh?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.780
COME 'ERE YA LITTLE-" *bleeep*

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:20.680
Almost all of them came back more placid, more prudent, and more inclined to see our planet as the fragile marble that it is.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.320
And as those lunar humans would look down on our fragile condition,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.980
we'd look up at them every night,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.400
and it would be a constant reminder not only of the power of human endeavor,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.700
but that we're out in the universe now.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.120
And surely that would change all of us down here.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.820
And if we're very lucky,

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.300
maybe even change us for the better.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.220
Fifty years later, we're still living in the shadow of the Apollo program,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.040
when hundreds of thousands of men and women came together,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.980
spent a titanic amount of money, utilized an ungodly amount of brainpower

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.580
to achieve something that was, by any estimation, impossible –

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.540
and they did it.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.300
Some days It feels like we've forgotten how to do this:

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.280
to dream crazy big – together,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.020
to reach for something – together,

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.500
to look out beyond bickering and this "my team-your team" rubbish.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.160
There's an infinite playground just waiting out there

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.200
for us, to explore as brothers and sisters.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.460
Obviously, the Apollo program came directly out of competition between the US and the Soviet Union.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.860
It's not like the US went to the Moon just 'cause they fancied a nice view.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.280
but the solidarity inside the Apollo program

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.620
and the directed attention of the American citizenry towards space

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.000
was like nothing we've ever seen before.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.900
Many of you watching this, and me – we weren't alive to see the Moon landings.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:36.660
We didn't grow up with a single event in media that was a human project, on behalf of the entire species.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:42.680
How will we feel when we see that first man or woman putting that first boot down on the red sands of Mars?

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.820
I, for one, will be crying my eyes out,

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.460
just happy I got to live long enough to see my species at the beginning of leaving its cradle

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.580
and finally learning to walk.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.560
And then we will learn to run:

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.300
to the orbits of Venus, Titan,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.160
Ganymede – wherever we feel like!

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.240
Because that is us. Because audacity is what we do.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.700
Sometimes violently, sometimes misguidedly,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.260
but sometimes, every now and then, in solidarity – together,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.140
and for the love of reaching one mountain peak just the look to the next.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.900
In our solar system waiting – for us! – there are seven new mountains,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.560
with seven new sunrises and seven new sets of secrets.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.620
And if THAT doesn't unify us – Christ, nothing will.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.920
And it will all start with the Moon, our home away from home,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.780
as the springboard into the multiplanetary age of the human being.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.640
"We choose to go back to the Moon and do the other things –

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.800
not because they are easy, but because they are cool!"

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.360
To follow our evolutionary imperative, as it began with our emergence from the oceans

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.360
and our many perilous diasporas across this great blue-green spaceship.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.480
"We've been on six dates together, Moon!

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.100
Sorry we ghosted you, we've been going through some stuff!

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.460
But we've changed, Moon – no more long distance, oh no,

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.080
let's get it together properly.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.200
We're sliding back into DMs, baby! How 'bout it?

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.540
Let's settle down together and raise a solar civilization, eh?"

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.500
These are precarious times.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.600
So too were they precarious half a century ago, when those first explorers set off for space.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.440
If we can hold it together, this might be just the beginning of the beginning for our species.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.740
Because we are currently audacity monkeys,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.780
but we could be forever monkeys, if we wanted to.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.120
And the moon is clearly our door...

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.720
into that forever.
