00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.470
Don’t shit yourself, whatever you do, don’t
do that or they’ll never let you fly again.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.960
If I shit myself, and we crash, maybe it will
act as a rudimentary air bag and I’ll be the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.849
only survivor.
No don’t do that, just stay calm, you’ll

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.629
be fine.
What is that on the wings, sticky tape? British

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.930
Airways would never put sticky tape on the
wings. This is simply outrageous.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.360
Maybe I can just get off, they can’t keep
me on here against my will and....Oh, no,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.960
I’m definitely going to die.
Jesus Christ, no one is going to live if we

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.050
crash from this height.
Did he just say catastrophic engine failure?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.550
I’m pretty sure that’s exactly what he just
said.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.290
Maybe if I just grip the armrest really hard
I can hold the plane together. Probably not

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.990
but maybe I’ll just keep doing it anyway.
Why is no one else bothered by this? It’s

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.770
cows in a slaughterhouse except without the
mooing.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.850
Where does the pee go now? Does it get sucked
out? What if it sucks all the air out too

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.980
and we all suffocate? I don’t want to suffocate.
Maybe I’ll just leave it there.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.030
No you can’t leave it, next we’ll all
be reading Gawker and shitting in the street.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.009
Oh that’s not that bad at all JESUS CHRIST
What the hell is that on the window? I have

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.899
literally no idea but it’s probably fatal.
Are the wings wobbling, why are the wings

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.369
wobbling, do wings wobble? Probably just before
they snap off

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.109
Oh good, the electrics have failed, have they?
Well I guess they weren’t vital to flying

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.959
the plane.
If you’re listening, Jesus, I appreciate

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:22.560
you’re probably quite angry about the...drugs
and that girl and the butt stuff last week,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.909
but I swear if you land the plane I’ll believe
in you, I absolutely promise, or if you’re

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.479
Jewish or Hindu or whatever, that’s fine
too, sign me up, just oh god please land the plane and I promise I'll

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.889
Hehe, nice try Jesus you statistically improbable...

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:39.949
