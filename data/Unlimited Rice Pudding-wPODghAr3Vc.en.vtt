00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
So you've just invented time travel.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.120
Well done, you clever little sausage.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.300
Let's go back and fix human history, then.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.920
Before you leave, though, why not pack a suitcase.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.820
But what to take, what to take.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.420
Well, obviously, shoes,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.300
toiletries,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.180
clothes,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.800
and depending on how you time machine works, how about

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.540
A FUCKING SPACESUIT!

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.700
Because if your time machine works like a teleporter,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.240
what do you think is gonna happen when you push the "go" button?

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.040
Let's say you want to pop just five hours back in time to breakfast.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.620
Well, the earth is orbiting the sun at about 67 thousand miles an hour,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.860
so you're not going to materialize at the kitchen table –

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.100
you're going to materialize where the kitchen table WILL BE in 5 hours,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.640
meaning the earth is now 335 thousand miles behind you.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.480
You...

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.000
doink.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.340
All right, so let's say your time machine isn't a teleporter, but just-

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.640
And that's even ignoring the fact that the earth and sun are also traveling through space together with the entire galaxy,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.320
and the galaxy is going at about 1.3 million miles an hour,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.980
so you'll probably end up in interstellar space alone.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.080
And DEAD.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.160
And alone.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.200
And DEAD!

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.560
Yeah, but really, let's just say your time machine isn't-

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.480
Well I guess you COULD launch yourself in a rocket,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.160
fly out to where the earth is GOING to be in exactly 5 hours,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.620
(somehow traveling faster than the galaxy – good luck)

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.120
then turn on your time machine and hope you got the calculations right,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.140
so you don't end up materializing in the ground when it catches up with you.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.060
But, really, okay, let's just say your time machine isn-

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.300
Yeah, but even then – what, you're just going to rematerialize in the air, are you?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.760
What about the air you're displacing when you pop out of nothing?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.060
How dense is a person?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.920
Well, about 985 kilograms per meters cubed.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920
Well, AIR is about 1.2 kilograms per meters cubed.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.580
So when you arrive, there'll be a huge compression of matter as you materialize,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.880
causing, at best, a bit of a whoosh noise,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.460
and at worst, a cheeky touch of...

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.300
Oh, heh...

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.220
Y'know...

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.460
NUCLEAR FUSION.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.280
So, really, let's assume your time machine isn't a teleporter,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.520
but something friendly, like a closed timelike curve,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.340
or a wormhole,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.120
or whatever...

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.120
Great. So. Go wrestle Genghis Khan,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.440
piss in Ceasar's lemonade...

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.020
Now, down to business.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.220
From herein we'll assume that

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.800
A) the past can be changed, and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.560
B) you're a sociopath.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.620
Let's see if we can nudge humanity off in a better direction, then, shall we?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.500
Step 1:

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.720
Don't be dead.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.860
Before going back in time, why not make sure you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.260
STAY THE FUCK ALIVE?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.560
Pack antibiotics, lots and lots of antibiotics –

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.540
especially doxycycline, if you're going anywhere near the bubonic plague.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.060
If you run out of antibiotics –

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.800
and under no circumstances do this unless you are, in fact, a stranded time traveller –

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.340
you can make very improvised penicillin by leaving moldy bread until it goes bluish.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.700
Also, if you aren't getting water from a well, or the rain, or an aqueduct,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.540
how 'bout don't drink that shit ever!?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.160
Boil ALL of your water first. Then you'll need to filter it.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.240
Find something bottle-ish, add a layer of charcoal, layer of sand –

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.380
hooray and a cheer...

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.700
You just beat diarrhea.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.580
Step 2:

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.380
Get clever.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.680
Before you go, read up on the basics of steam power,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.520
harmonic oscillators, pendulum clocks,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.220
germ theory, modern military strategy,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.440
monarchic history, the schematics of the printing press,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.400
and ALL the card tricks you can stand,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.720
using mnemonic technique to commit stuff to memory.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.080
A good one is the person-action-object system.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.940
Let's say you want to remember the dates of...

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.880
Oh, I dunno,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.700
solar eclipses – for no reason in particular...

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.620
We'll aim for memorizing about 30 of them, so pick ones in the time and location of whichever era you're going to.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.800
Now, you need to remember the date of the eclipse and the exact time of day.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.200
Now come up with at least ten people, ten actions, and ten objects.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.500
So let's say we're trying to remember the number 326.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.000
Well, 3 in the people list is Winston Churchill,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.540
2 in the objects is "wash",

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.960
and 6 is a unicorn.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.080
So Winston Churchill washing a unicorn.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.520
326 is easy to forget, but good luck getting THAT image out of your head, though.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.720
Next, memorize any embarrassing secrets we now know about the monarchy of the time you're going to,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.080
and congratulations – you now have the foresight...

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.060
of a god.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.260
Now, pack some gold, and silk, and nylon,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.840
and a laser pen, and an air horn,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.800
and some special choccies, because... yeah.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.820
Personally, as an English native speaker, I would wander back to 14th century England, because

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.180
A) it's before the Enlightenment, and people will be way easier to bullshit,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.000
and B) further back, and there isn't enough metallurgy, and they'll be speaking Old English.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.020
But it's your time machine – do whatever.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.260
Off you fuck, then.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.120
Upon arriving, if I were you, I would rig your time machine so you can't possibly go back before whenever you've landed.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.380
Otherwise, if you screw up, you might be tempted to go back again, and again, and interfere with yourself,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.720
creating a shitstorm of temporal paradoxes.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.060
Anyway, welcome to the past – it smells weird, and everyone talks funny.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.280
So, step 3, then:

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.960
Become a living deity.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.660
But first, remember that English is a bit of a work in progress,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.960
and even just decades back from our own century, and you sound suspicious.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.400
Stick to the hundred most common words in modern English, and you'll hopefully be all right.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.160
Still, if you open your mouth in public...

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.180
You're boned.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.680
Locate someone vaguely trustworthy, but not TOO clever,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.120
give them some gold, make sure they understand your instructions.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.640
From now on, they speak for you.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.060
Next, you need to dress up in all that silk and nylon.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.280
Nylon won't be invented until 1935, and silk is still rare in Europe at the time.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.980
People will love that shit!

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.900
Now introduce modern music.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.920
The rhythms are so alien that people will immediately flock to it.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.340
♫ My milkshake brings all the lads to the courtyard, ♫

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.360
♫ They're like, "It's better than yours", ♫

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.380
♫ Jehovah, it's better than yours, ♫

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.140
♫ I can teach you – better check with the priest... ♫

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.020
Grand. Next, go out in the streets, and get your spokesperson to announce the next solar eclipse,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.100
which you've memorized.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.300
People are gonna freak out a bit, so let off your air horn a few times, flash your laser pen about a bit –

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.880
make a song and dance of it, yeah?

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.860
When the solar eclipse happens, immediately announce the next one, and claim it's you doing it.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.840
If people say:

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.200
"Hey! You didn't do that!"

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.080
just say:

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.620
"Y... Yes I did!"

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.240
Teach your followers basic hygiene,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.620
teach them modern battle strategy,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.560
teach them the foundations of royal rule, and how flimsy it is.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.300
People might talk funny in the past, but power still relies on more or less the same foundations as today,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.020
namely weapons and money.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.140
The monarchy WILL send an army, and they WILL attempt to make you dead.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.200
You can't win against that, however clever you are.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.440
So instead...

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.860
Incite revolution.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.920
Most of the monarchs at the time retain their power by the threat of violence,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.400
and the promise that God put them there by divine right.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.140
Invent Gutenberg's printing press decades before Gutenberg,

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.320
begin churning out pamphlet after pamphlet laying out the embarrassing secrets of the current king.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.000
Step up antibiotic production,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.500
cure people of basic ailments,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.100
move you and your followers to a remote patch of the countryside, declare it independent,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.320
give it a flashy name.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.840
Perform miracles every now and then –

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.160
card tricks will go down really well, probably: people haven't seen them before in Europe.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.400
Have your followers track down the finest engineers of the day –

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.480
I would recommend Filippo Brunelleschi and Guido da Vigevano.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.340
Begin constructing basic steam engines,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.700
use them to pump clean water up from the ground for all your mates and followers.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.000
Have an elaborate underground temple built for you.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.800
Disappear inside with your time machine, only let your spokesperson come out and give orders.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.460
Leave behind extremely specific instructions about how to begin the Industrial Revolution early,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.280
and grow your army, and maintain your future empire, and design good irrigation.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.260
Finally, have a very basic periscope constructed, and stick it out the top of your temple.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.040
So let's travel a few decades into the future and see how everything is going.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.800
Slowly accelerate the passage of time.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.180
Day and night will begin to pass visibly in front of you,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.560
until the sun appears a single golden line across the twilight sky.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.540
The seasons fleeting by in seconds.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.020
The fevered commotion of insects no more than a blur.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.920
Then the flurry of passersby outside, of generations waxing and waning,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.920
of great structures built in your name,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.200
the fingerprints of science and philosophy born long before its time,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.060
the drumbeat of industry coming alive.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.900
The development of modern medicine, of
scientific materialism, of the mastery of nature,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.600
of the acknowledgment of the right of all humans to exist in a state of international equanimity.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.920
The dawn of an age where millions need not die of disease, of hardship, of war.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.660
You steer humanity now.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.000
There have been leaders and thinkers and sages throughout history,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.700
but none of them had your advantages.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.900
Now you can refashion history in the image of dignity, and kindness,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.260
and universal concern for every human alive.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.280
And all of it presided over by you:

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.160
half human, half deity.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.540
Moral, just, indomitable, indefatigable.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.300
How noble in reason.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.100
How infinite in faculty.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.240
In apprehension how like a god!

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.580
Well, I mean...

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.840
Not a god, technically, because people can still revolt against you, and you can't do anything about it.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.340
So let's try a few changes in tactic.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.300
To protect your master plan, direct technology towards absolute surveillance of the population,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.040
towards a perfect political science,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.520
towards total hegemony.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.020
If you want to help humanity, you'll need to live a long time,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.000
so order your scientists to research a
cure for aging.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.460
Drop by to collect the rewards of the new sciences and become immortal.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.120
Enhance yourself with electronic augmentation.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.740
The problem with humanity – too much freedom and leisure time. Remove both.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.840
Ban books, ban mass communication.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.820
Rule undisputed, technology in your left hand, power in your right,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.860
dropping in occasionally to make alterations

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.560
or dispense great justice and retribution – in the name of peace.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.880
Shepherd humans up to the local planets, establish colonies, then spread out to the stars.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.140
Create a galactic empire ruled with imperious malice, lest humanity revert back to its bad habits.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.500
There'll be no love, except the love of you.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.940
There'll be no art, no literature, no science.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.340
Total domination.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.720
Unimaginable power.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.320
Unlimited rice pudding.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.060
Who could stand in your way now?

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.660
Who would fucking dare?!

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.620
As monarch of the galaxy.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.280
As pilot of history.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.720
As God Emperor of time...

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.260
Darling, I'm just putting the kettle on, do you want someth-

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.340
Oh for fuck s- what does that say on the door, mom?

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.260
"25 metres swimming certificate for-"

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.200
No, the...

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.080
The other one.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.580
"Don't come in – recording".

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.700
Right. So?..

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.160
Well sorry, I just wanted to know if you wanted a cup of-

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.160
Ugh, it's too late – I've lost my whole... megalomania... shtick.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.060
*Sigh* Just...

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.400
Earl Grey and...

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.980
no... no sugar. And can you-

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.740
*Sigh*

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.780
Can you bring the special biscuits in, please?..
