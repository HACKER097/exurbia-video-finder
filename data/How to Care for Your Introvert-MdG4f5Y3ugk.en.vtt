00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
One of the main differences between introverts and

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.780
extroverts, is that extroverts get their energy from

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.700
hanging out with other people,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.300
whereas introverts...aren't mentally ill.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.820
Now, if you're looking to get an introvert,you can either adopt a baby one,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.820
known as a "Shylet"

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.900
Or rescue an adult from an introvert shelter.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.740
Generally referred to as a "Library".

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.080
On arriving home, show your new introvert the location of the litter tray, the feeding bowl,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.960
and any windows it can jump out of in case the doorbell rings.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.900
A pair of introverts is called an "Awkward"

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.120
A group of introverts is called an "Angst"

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.160
They are generally never found together in the wild

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.200
except by accident

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.740
in which case they will apologize for making eye-contact, nod politely, then run screaming in opposite directions.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.540
Contrary to popular belief, introverts don't dislike human company

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.580
They just utterly despise it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.000
Interaction with introverts can be problematic

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.940
A typical conversation might run:

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.900
Extrovert: Hi

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.940
Introvert: Helloooo

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.400
Extrovert: How's it going?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.720
Introvert: Yes.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.680
Introvert: (F**k!)

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.800
Extrovert:What?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.180
Introvert: Haha, how about that much anticipated sports match last night eh?

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.620
Extrovert: What?

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.340
Introvert: FU...!

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.600
Introvert: Stuff over here to do a bit now, better runaroo

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.180
Extrovert: What?

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.900
Introvert: Mmmnnnnnnne-eeeeaaaaaaaa

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.580
Extrovert: What?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.440
Introvert: F**k...!

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.020
Introversion itself probably results from a genetic mutation

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.900
In fact, introvert DNA is oriented in parallel lines,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.420
As the two chains are too embarrassed to twist around on each other.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.640
This leads to an enlarged "Sorrybellum"

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.520
and a malformed "Anxietal Lobe".

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.340
However, introverts make for excellent fighting animals.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.880
They will level up from Occasional Reader, to Social Hermit,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.120
then with enough experience evolve into their final form, Professional EVE: Online Player.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.700
The introvert class comes with a low-maintenance cost,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.800
but extremely high embarrassment risk.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.020
Against extroverts, they can use the "Retreat to Toilet" move,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.060
to recover HP

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.020
Deploy the "Agreeable Conversation" defense block

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.260
but are totally useless against the "Direct Eye-Contact" attack.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.860
*shhoooweee..!!*

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.820
*blip bloop 8 bit-noises*

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.760
If you want to reward your introvert, why not treat it to,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.800
A colorful toy,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.920
A tummy rub,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.820
Not forcing it to talk publicly about its emotions ever,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.280
And not forcing it to talk publicly about its emotions,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.200
F**king ever.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.980
Mistreating your introvert may prompt a visit from the "Antisocial Services"

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.660
So try to avoid: belittling your introvert in front of its friends,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.540
Manhandling the first editions of books,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.200
Talking s**t about Kurt Vonnegut,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.980
Or, insisting on phoning, rather than texting.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.180
*vrrrrrrrm* (vibrating samsung phone)

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.320
*vrrrrrrrm* (vibrating samsung phone)

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.620
(Introvert God hammer:) *bang* *bang* *bang*

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.320
*vibrate*

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.940
**Unintelligible introvert grunting / defense calls**

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.540
*HAMMER MASHING*

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.500
Failure to observe these instructions

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.180
May result in your introvert exhibiting

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.960
extremely backhanded compliments,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.180
a lack of polite sign-offs at the end of e-mails,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.040
or serving your tea only lukewarm

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.100
and it tasting suspiciously like piss.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.300
Like most humans, introverts do have romantic tendencies,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.600
Generally, the mating call goes something like:

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.620
Introvert: Sorry I... don't mean to interrupt but... is someone sitting here?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.260
No?

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.840
Ah..

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.360
Hmmm....

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.300
Actually, I... I think I left the gas on. *Heeeuuuuuuuu* (Chokes up)

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.380
"GOODBYE FOREVER" (choking)

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.160
Directness can also be an issue.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.400
How's it going? Generally equates to: I find you very attractive.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.140
Hope to see you again = I'm falling quite madly in love

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.100
And, "I think about you occasionally", translates as:

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.100
"I would literally remove my ears with a rusty spoon just to see you with your socks off."

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.620
Dating an introvert can be quite an experience

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.660
A romantic evening might consist of the two of you having a glass of wine and reading a book together,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.340
separated only by being in different countries, and communicating in no way whatsoever.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.080
If you grow tired of your introvert,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.820
No need to pawn it off on a friend

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.380
Simply disconnect the router, or suggest that it might've offended someone slightly,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.160
and it will quietly run away in the night.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.780
Owners do occasionally come to resemble their pets.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.540
You yourself might be an introvert without realizing, if you:

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.480
Find yourself mentally exhausted after hanging out with people,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.340
Even those you like,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.720
Enjoy dining or going to the movies alone,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.620
Go to leave your apartment, notice your neighbor is out in the hallway,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.040
Then suddenly grow convinced that you need to go back inside to do some

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.380
"Important Stuff"

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.820
Consider small talk the verbal equivalent of integral calculus

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.980
Or utilize a ten-point grading system in your head for how the conversation is going so far.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.980
With the Postman.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.980
In any case though, if you're looking for a pet that isn't constantly defacing the furniture,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.460
Or trying to murder you in your sleep,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.620
Why not get an introvert?

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.780
Not as good as dogs, but much less likely to piss everywhere.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.580
Bye.
