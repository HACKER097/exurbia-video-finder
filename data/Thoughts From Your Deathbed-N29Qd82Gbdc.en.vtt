00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.320
On your deathbed

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.720
you will think back in your life,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.740
and you might have...

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.580
regrets.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.400
You will wish you'd worked harder,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.360
made more money,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.740
spent less time with your family,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.080
less time with your friends.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.220
You will reminisce fondly

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.300
about all the evenings you stayed home alone,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.720
so you could refresh Facebook

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.540
over

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.340
and over.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.300
On your deathbed

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.180
you will be grateful for many things.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.240
Thank God you stayed in that job you hated

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.920
for fear of rocking the boat.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.620
Thank God you settle for friendships with total bellends

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.200
instead of making the effort to meet people

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.420
who were on your wavelength.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.480
Thank God you ignored your dream career,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.500
so you wouldn't upset your family.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.440
On your deathbed

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.640
you'll be glad you didn't tell these humans you loved

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.500
that you loved them

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.900
before they were gone forever.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.400
You'll be glad you spent years taking

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.000
passive-aggressive comments personally

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.780
from people who are probably just miserable dicks themselves.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.500
You'll be glad

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.460
that you were too cautious

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.780
to pursue your actual passions in life.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.600
On your deathbed

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.740
you certainly won't think back

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.520
on whatever it is you worried about constantly,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.460
and laugh at how utterly insignificant it actually was compared

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.580
to what a fucking amazing time you could have been having

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.600
with a body that hadn't started falling apart yet

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.160
in an age more enlightened

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.560
than any that have come before,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.680
while the people you loved was still alive.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.140
You were young back then,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.780
and that was a resource more sought-after than antimatter,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.200
more expensive than a hero

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.920
in Star Wars Battlefront 2.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.080
Life was fleeting

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.120
and luckily you wasted the entire thing.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.020
What's that?

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.660
You only have an extremely limited period of time alive

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.280
well

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.680
better polish off another one then

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.440
to that German Dominatrix whose name you can neither pronounce

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.260
nor remember,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.700
and then write a long list of things you do tomorrow,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.040
which you will somehow find an excuse not to

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.920
for the four thousandth day running.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.100
When you were young

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.480
you wanted a million things.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.520
On your deathbed

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.740
you want only one

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.820
and that is to be young again

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.940
On your deathbed

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.200
you certainly won't start having awful realizations,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.760
like how the point of making money

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.980
probably wasn't to make money,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.640
but to do cool stuff with it for yourself and others.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.280
That the point of a long life

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.780
probably wasn't to put off your real plans until tomorrow,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.160
but rather to give you more time to pursue them today.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.160
Now literally fucking now

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.400
that the points are being a talking monkey in space

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.060
probably wasn't to sit watching YouTube videos

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.860
by some pompous British knob end

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.300
but to have a good time with what little time there was

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.680
And to make other talking monkeys feel good, too.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.500
You were born into an age

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
science fiction couldn't even imagine.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.600
When your species had access to clean drinking water through magic pipes,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.940
to practically infinite information through magic wires,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.440
to devices that can materialize

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.280
pizza in magic boxes at your door within 1 hour...

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.040
or less.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.140
Despite being surrounded by miracles on a daily basis,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.200
despite being matter that has woken up,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.800
despite the entire universe

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.320
contriving to create you,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.340
you still convinced yourself that the odds were stacked against you,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.160
somehow.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.780
That all the good ideas have been had,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.620
apparently,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.000
and that everything is shit

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
for some reason.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.620
So...

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.260
great.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.640
However you saw it at the time,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.160
the future was a branching network

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.960
of opportunities and adventure.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.220
At any moment you could have begun the project of refashioning your life into what you actually

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.340
wanted it to look like.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.300
There would be risks,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.600
there would be bad days,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.740
there would be stress,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.600
but that was nothing

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.600
compared to the misery of realizing the entire lifetime had been wasted on doubts and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.580
self-sabotage.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.600
The hard road was easy.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.220
The easy road was hard.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.420
It took 14 billion years to make you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.160
and only 90 to fuck it up.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.020
And with self-doubt and apathy you did fuck it up.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120
But that is irrelevant now,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.080
at the end

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.380
all things considered,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.600
all beds made

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.240
or I's dotted and T's crossed

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.640
because...

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.560
On your deathbed

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.380
you will think back on your life,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.740
and you may have regrets.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.280
You will wish you'd worked harder,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.240
made more money,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.060
spent less time with your family,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.540
less time with your friends.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.680
And maybe even closed this tab on your browser

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.180
and began taking steps towards going off to your actual passions.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.900
Back

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.360
when you still had your entire life ahead of you...

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.440
And really

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.780
only yourself...

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.740
In your way.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.140
Hey, I hope you like books about the future

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.820
and physics and AI

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.760
because I just put one up online...

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.220
The first section anyway.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.700
It's set partly in the present,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.360
partly ten thousand years from now.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.460
It has cats and squares and

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.080
cats and it's nothing like my other stuff.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.600
There's also lots of sciencing,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.380
mmm

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.240
your favorite.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.000
Link below if you are interested,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.760
link below if you're not interested,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.560
link below if you are apathetic.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.720
A massive thank you to everyone who supported the channel on patreon

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.340
I could not have written this without you,

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.780
and I am eternally grateful.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.360
Thanks I hope you like it.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.020
Goodbye

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.840
etc.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.000
(And a massive thank you to you, too, Exurb1a, for giving us so many good videos and existential crisis. Keep up the good work &lt;3)
