00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.820
I was maybe six years old, driving somewhere at night with my dad,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.740
and I took a little nap, and I woke up, and he said:

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.880
"Where did you go?"

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.840
And I said:
"I... dunno."

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.520
And he said:
"Well, what do you reckon sleep is for?"

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.580
And I said:
"I... dunno."

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.960
And he said:
"Sleep's kinda weird though, huh?"

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.520
And I said:
"...Eeeh..."

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.980
And he said:
"Sleep is a lot like dying, really, isn't it?"

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.940
And I said:

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.980
"I'm six FUCKING YEARS OLD!"

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.160
The Greek god of sleep is called Hypnos.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.680
He has a brother called Thanatos, and he's the god of death.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.900
This is gonna be a jolly 10 minutes!

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.440
Sleep makes no sense.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.700
It leaves us completely defenseless for hours on end,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.200
and it probably isn't even for saving energy, either.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.660
Compared to just lying around awake, sleep will save you about a hundred calories,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.980
or a banana of slightly above average... girth.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.120
Humans need about eight hours sleep a night, but our animal friends vary wildly.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.020
Koalas prefer 22 hours,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.240
bunnies about nine,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.720
elephants need just four,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.380
and however badly your day is going,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.840
I would like to invite you to just enjoy this picture of an elephant calf taking a nap for a moment.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.760
There. That's better, isn't it?

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.660
No, me neither.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.620
But whatever sleep is for, it's so essential that nature wired it into almost every half-intelligent organism on the planet.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.060
For example, dolphins.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.040
If they slept like us, they would drown, because they don't have gills, and they need oxygen.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.760
So they sleep unihemispherically – that is, they float just below the water,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.500
and one side of their brain sleeps while the other stays awake, then they swap over.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.720
Human death rehearsal –

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.600
heh, excuse me, I mean, sleep –

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.020
is a bit more straightforward:

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.980
teeth, toilet, spot of hysterical crying – and it's off to the Land of Nod.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.000
Stage 1: brainwaves slow down a bit.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.860
Stage 2: your pulse will slow down, and you'll begin producing sleep spindles,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.720
which are little bursts of brainwaves that...

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.100
Well, we don't know what they do exactly, but

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.860
they look a bit- they look a bit like that...

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.600
So...

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.180
heh...

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.920
Yeah...

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.660
Stages 3 and 4 are the deepest levels of sleep.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.020
Growth hormone is released, tissue is being repaired,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.420
then stage 5:

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.640
Rapid Eye Movement, or REM stage.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.080
Your brain kindly paralyzes your body, mostly;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.100
the eyes roll about, the face twitches,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.320
brainwaves go mental,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.720
and this is where about 80% of dreams occur.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.300
Anyway, the funny part about all this, of course, is when we're not dreaming while asleep –

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.820
where do we go?

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.520
It's just black, it's just oblivion – every night, over and over.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.080
Because sleep is just death being shy.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.480
If we got news that an asteroid was approaching, scheduled for arrival, say, 60 years from now,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.420
and it was so gigantic it would wipe out our entire civilization,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.460
we would probably go fucking nuclear.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.100
Riots, war – maybe end the world before the asteroid even arrived.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.280
And yet, there IS an asteroid, approaching slowly in the distance,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.160
but it only gets one of us at a time,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.760
and we practice for it every night.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.720
And its name... is Death.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.960
With an asteroid, the whole species will be gone in a few days, probably.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.880
With death as it stands today, though,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.680
maybe we take comfort in the fact that even though we'll be gone,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.920
the world will still carry on without us.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.980
But ignoring technology and politics, we do know a bit about the future we'll all miss out on.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.100
And if it cheers you up, we can take a little tour of that future.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.940
Just for fun, let's say sometime in the next few years you become a parent to two children,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.380
and that the average human generation cycle is about 30 years.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.740
Well, by the 2080s we're two generations down the line.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.240
You are now a grandparent, and six humans have inherited your DNA.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.480
If humans have made it to Mars, on November 10th, 2084,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.600
the colonists will witness the transit of Earth from Mars –

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.840
the Earth resembling a black disc, passing across the Sun.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.080
2110, another generation later,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.240
and assuming humans have, on average, two children,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.460
your children have grandchildren now, and you have 14 descendants.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.640
It's quite possible they attended your funeral.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.480
Don't worry, everyone got smashed in the pub afterwards, and said nice things about your hair.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.760
The world population is probably around 11 billion humans, having jumped 4 billion in just a century.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.860
The 2140s, another generation.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.160
All things being equal, 30 humans now carry your genes.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.780
2200 – another generation – and we're into the 23rd century.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.840
Halley's Comet has just reached its perihelion;

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.800
you have 62 descendants.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.240
The mid-2200s, now six generations –

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.360
that's 126 descendants of yours.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.760
Leeloo and Korben Dallas will shortly be initiating a romantic relationship,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.580
and by the end of this century, still at two children per generation,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.040
you now have 2050 descendants.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.500
We can no longer even speculate what culture and technology looks like, so...

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.200
Year 12,000 AD, 240 generations later.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.960
If sex is even still in fashion, you now have at least several million descendants.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.480
The star Antares has just gone supernova, probably,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.880
and will be visible from the Earth even in daylight.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.240
Year 52,000 AD, 1,500 generations of your progeny later,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.940
and the Earth's rotation will have slowed enough, courtesy of the Moon,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.600
that we'll need to add a leap second to preserve timekeeping.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.940
Year 100,000 AD, 3,000 generations later.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.920
You might recognize the constellations, but they'll be altered –

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.380
the handle of the Big Dipper getting a little relaxed at the back, for example.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.620
250,000 AD, 7,500 generations later.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.840
Loihi, currently a submarine volcano in 2019, will have risen out of the ocean and become a volcanic island.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.280
2 million AD.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.060
The Grand Canyon erodes to surround the Colorado River,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.800
if there is, indeed, still a Colorado River left.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.220
50 million AD.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.840
Eurasia and Africa collide, forming an entirely new mountain range.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.960
500 to 600 million AD.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.440
It's possible Earth's continents have fused back into a single supercontinent.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.800
A day on Earth has probably gained at least an hour.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.400
Our moon is now so distant, solar eclipses never happen again.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.860
One billion AD.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.880
The Sun is now ten percent more luminous, meaning our oceans have begun to evaporate.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.920
Plant life is... unlikely.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.440
Four billion AD.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.860
The Milky Way, our galaxy, and our neighboring galaxy Andromeda collide, forming Milkomeda.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.120
Ten billion AD.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.220
The Sun is now 256 times its current size, and has almost certainly swallowed Mercury, Venus, and Earth.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.700
One trillion AD.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.420
It's possible the Big Crunch has now begun, the remains of the universe falling back in on herself.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.580
Galactic clusters will begin to converge, stars will collide,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.100
the resulting explosions illuminating the heavens nearby and distant.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.180
Eventually, the black holes of the universe will collide with one another,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.860
amassing into a single super-supermassive black hole consuming itself.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.760
One quadrillion AD.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.940
It's also possible no Big Crunch will occur, and the universe will continue to expand indefinitely.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.180
In this scenario the main points of interest for the next almost infinite period of time will be the decay of nucleons –

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.640
that's protons and neutrons –

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.560
beginning an era in which only black holes exist in the universe,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.980
and, assuming a new universe has not begun,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.780
the current universe will achieve its final resting energy:

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.520
uninhabited, uninhabitable, barren –

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.380
perpetual, limitless dark,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.580
with no recourse to the fecundity that once teemed within the boundaries of creation.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.180
We all must have gone through that phase as a kid, when it hit us:

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.640
"Well, people die eventually,

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.900
and mom and dad are people,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.280
and I'm a person, so...

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.580
OH GOD!"

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.660
Some of us, including your pompous narrator here, never recovered from that phase.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.860
It is simply too much: to live as the only animal that knows its projects and loves and lifetimes are limited,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.480
and when the animal is gone, after a while it'll be as though the animal never was at all.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.400
And that is a notion too wide and spiky to fit inside the head.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.420
The things we will miss after we're gone:

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.040
the parties, the births of humans we would come to love,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.640
all the walks, all the hugs,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.880
all the plucky steps into the dark our species will take yet.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.920
Homo sapiens?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.120
Yeah, right – homo nihilus, more like.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.700
The only animal conscious of its approaching demise,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.180
and conscious of the world's approaching demise, too.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.180
I suspect you, like me, have run into these people in life,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.400
who are terribly clever, and yet terribly broken.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.960
Because they've looked into the abyss and concluded that on a long enough time scale,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.180
and in a universe so wide and apparently indifferent, we have no ultimate significance,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.560
and the point has dropped out of everything for them.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.640
But there IS a middle way between denial – "I'm so fucking important, look at my bank balance", etc. –

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.920
and despair – "there's no point to anything if we all just go off into the dark", etc.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.920
Because the world is just this fantastical as it is horrific,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.060
and it's just as arbitrary to lose hope as it is to find it.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.060
If everything was forever, would that really change so much?

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.740
80 years or a trillion – beer would still taste just as good, wasps would still be pricks –

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.820
Fuck you, wasps!

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.980
– and maybe tomorrow we'll kill aging, and death, and stay up infinitely past bedtime.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.560
But as it stands today, we don't have the science yet.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.080
And so, god-fearing or not, we have to find some way of making peace with the thing.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.320
For you it might be religion, or some variant of spirituality – and, fair enough.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.520
But I'll tell you what works for me personally, though.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.280
When it's late, and I can't sleep, and the abyss starts whispering about how I'm gonna go into the dark one day,

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.840
I keep in mind that whether I like it or not, I am part of something bigger –

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.120
an experiment conducted across the entire planet,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.840
conducted across all of history –

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.000
called "us".

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.600
Somewhere in the future, we are gone, and someone who loves us is remembering us.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.220
Somewhere ahead of that, they are gone, and someone who loves them is remembering them.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.520
The interminable rise and fall of generations.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.940
How many of us have been and gone down here since we became Homo sapiens?

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.580
Billions, at the very least.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.200
To have stubbed one's toe,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.940
to have heard a new word and looked it up,

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.240
to have yelled at the GPS as though it's the GPS's fault you got lost,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.260
to have watched another human blowing their nose or picking their teeth, or something equally disgusting, and quietly thought to oneself,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.000
"Oh, fuck – I've fallen in love with you, haven't I..."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.080
Just to have BEEN anything – what a weird honor!

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.340
If sleep is just death being shy, then waking up is atoms being miraculous.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.320
The fact that for about 80 years atoms know they're even atoms at all,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.080
courtesy of being humans.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.340
Birth, death, the silly bit in between –

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.540
if none of it has any ultimate significance,

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.000
if, on a cosmic scale, none of it matters...

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.720
does that really fucking matter?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.100
We won't last forever, but while we're here,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.560
What a silly decision it would be to waste our day out in the cosmos –

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.160
that brief period of time when matter woke up,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.140
on a world as interesting as this one,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.900
with hair as excellent as yours,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.660
with all the other talking carbon units around us

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.640
that we can hang out with, and be fond of, and talk shit to,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.660
and keep the abyss well at bay.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.340
And if all that wasn't enough, just in case...

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.880
In the words of Ursula K. Le Guin, a human who left us just last year:

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.880
"When I take you to the Valley, you'll see the blue hills on the left and the blue hills on the right,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.480
the rainbow and the vineyards under the rainbow late in the rainy season,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.840
and maybe you’ll say, 'There it is, that’s it!'

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.740
But I’ll say, 'A little farther.'

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.340
We’ll go on, I hope,

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.520
and you’ll see the roofs of the little towns and the hillsides yellow with wild oats,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.800
a buzzard soaring and a woman singing by the shadows of a creek in the dry season,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.600
and maybe you’ll say, 'Let’s stop here, this is it!'

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.740
But I’ll say, 'A little farther yet.'

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.880
And we’ll go on, and you’ll hear the quail calling on the mountain by the springs of the river,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.820
and looking back you’ll see the river running downward through the wild hills behind, below,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.120
and you’ll say, 'Isn’t that the Valley?'

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.260
And all I will be able to say

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.400
is 'Drink this water of the spring,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.920
rest here awhile,

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.540
we have a long way yet to go,

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.500
and I can’t go without you.'”
