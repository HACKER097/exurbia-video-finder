00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.260
This is not a badger's moustache,

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.960
or an excessively ugly pelican,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.220
it's an apostrophe.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.760
The king of punctuation.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.160
And boy, is it being misused on a regular basis.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.560
Sometimes, apostrophes make stuff possessive,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.480
like if Tom has... say,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.860
significant doubts about that last gram of bath salts.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.860
The doubts belong to Tom, right?

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.480
So those are Tom's significant doubts about that last gram of bath salts,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.020
and we give Tom an apostrophe.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.660
If the noun already ends in an 'S',

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.460
like Dolores, and Dolores has... say,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.500
some reservations about huffing a third can of

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.160
Lemon drizzle coloured Dulux paint,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.680
then the apostrphe goes after the 'S' to make it possessive.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.880
So, Dolores' reservations about huffing a third can of

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.060
lemon drizzle Dulux paint.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.120
Apostrophes are also used for contractions,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.820
like 'it's', which is just a shortened version of 'it is'.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.040
You don't need an apostrophe to make it possessive.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.960
For example,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020
if the cat shredded important financial documents,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.620
then that's 'its mistake'.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.420
If we give it an apostrophe, it makes it short for 'It is',

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.660
and the sentence is 'It is mistake' which is non-English!

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.540
Boy, commas are also tired of being messed around.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.600
"Let's eat, kids!", which is a healthy exclamation while dining,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.000
as opposed to "Let's eat kids!", stating rather explicitly-

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.760
you are, in fact, a cannibal.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.620
However, commas can't just be cast in any old role though.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840
They aren't fucking- Matthew McCommahey.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.860
and throwing in [breath] willy-nilly commas will lead [breath]

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.560
to a fractured [breath]

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.000
sentence.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.220
Myself, I am on team Oxford Comma.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.460
An Oxford Comma is the optional

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.620
(but not really optional)

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.160
comma one uses in a list.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.200
Here's an example:

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.580
"Let me introduce you to my wife, my best friend, (Oxford Comma)

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.120
and my sister." Sounds reasonable enough doesn't it?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.900
If you don't use the Oxford comma, instead you get:

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.300
"Let me introduce you to my wife, my best friend and my sister."

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.800
So yeah,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.980
good luck with that you Targaryen freak.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.900
Moving on.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.340
Hey, who's this little chap?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
It's a semicolon, the pretentious foie gras of grammar.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.500
But it's not! It's awesome and here's why and shut up-

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.820
Semicolons are tip-top for joining two ideas that have equal weights.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.700
For example:

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.040
Semicolons are useful; (semicolon)

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.540
They also desperately scream "I'm a university gradua-"

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.700
It can also link two clauses that stand alone.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.480
Such as: "I appear to have trapped my junk in a filing cabinet; (semicolon)

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.480
I might not be joining you for mojitos."

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.400
We should probably also talk about confused pronouns.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.500
"After putting the cat in the car, Rebecca drove it home."

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.320
Oh I- I see, cats are now drivable, are they?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.920
How big is said cat?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.620
How does one operate said cat?

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.540
Mine doesn't even acknowledge my existence,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.060
Let alone double up as a mode of fucking transport!

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.880
Imaginary plural possessives.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.560
Hey, what's you guyses thoughts about that?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.440
We have no thoughts about that, because that is a grammatical abomination.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.480
"I made a 360 degree change."

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.360
Yeah, okay. Let's just visualise that one.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.040
In your previous life you were, say, kidnapping dalmatians,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.260
and turning them into burgers,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.980
but after some consideration you developed a conscience

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.100
and executed a full 360 change and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.200
and that's a circle, you're still making dog burgers, Jesus Christ!

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.460
"I made a one hundred and eighty degree change."

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.800
"I could care less"

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.560
Which means presumably, you do still care,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.920
and you have a lot more not caring to get done,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.760
so that's great, but it doesn't really communicate anything.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.040
"I couldn't care less"

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.080
"First come first serve"

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.740
"First come, first served"

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.820
It has to be served, otherwise that would mean the first people to enter the restaurant

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.340
would unexpectedly find themselves working there.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.740
Affect and effect.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.280
Usually, people mean the verb Affect with an 'A'

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.820
because it means to influence something,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.400
like "Your face is affecting my peace of mind."

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.040
To effect is to bring something arround,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.940
like "After seeing your face, the government effected drastic legislative changes."

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.340
I.e. versus E.g.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.800
E.g. is for examples, like "drugs are bad for you,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.100
e.g. heroin, cocaine, Stellaris, et cetera."

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.240
I.e. is used for clarification.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.160
Drugs are bad for you.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.960
I.e. you sit down to play a spot of Stellaris over lunch

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.500
and suddenly a decade has passed and you're now thirty-eight.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.820
and you still haven't got up to pee, and it's not even the middle of the fucking game yet!

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.380
Their, they're and there.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.220
Hm.. This one is easy enough.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.140
Well, 'their' is possessive.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.820
If a troop of leprechauns is closing in on your position

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.780
with laser guided fusion powered sniper rifles,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.800
then that's 'their' assault party.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.200
If it helps, a good trick is to remember that 'their' is spelt like that

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.740
is because its.. right.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.940
If we're using the contraction of they are though, such as the leprechaun assault team is here,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.100
and 'they're' going to go full on Jules Winnfield when they get inside the house,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.060
we use the apostrophe 'R' 'E' form,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.600
because again, it's a contraction of 'they are',

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.900
And if we're using the preposition, such as:

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.140
"Shit, i lost the assault leprechauns, where are they?

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.480
Oh, just crouching sinisterly behind the wheely bin,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.560
over there,"

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.060
then it's 'E' 'R' 'E'.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.940
And finally, if you're curious, then your interest is Piqued,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.860
if you say something nice, its a compliment,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.500
but if it brightens someones day, then it complemented it,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.140
and if someone insists on breaking the above rules, despite knowing exactly how they work,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.440
well, fair enough.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.800
after all, it's their language too, right?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.740
No!

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.600
You aren't allowed to freestyle with traffic laws, or math!

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600
So why language?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.320
Need I remind you that political tensions are running high?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.600
That a global pandemic could spring up at any time?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.300
That the bees are rather poorly at present and we don't know why?

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.540
We're balancing on the bloody existential cliff edge here,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.300
so with all that in mind, just

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.340
fucking

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.640
'I' before 'E' except after 'C',

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.380
alwight?
