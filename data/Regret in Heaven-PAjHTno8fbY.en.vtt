00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
You woke up and you're in a white room, and there's a thing in the white room with you,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.780
and you said "Where am I?"

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.340
And the thing said "Ah yeah..You're a bit dead, but everything's fine."

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.500
And you said "I'm dead? My God. How did it happen?"

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.640
"ah... Embarrassingly? Don't worry about it. You want some Kombucha tea?"

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.480
"What?"

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.740
"No, it's fine. Everything's fine. You're safe here."

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.420
"What about my family and my wife? She'll be lonely! What would she do?"

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.020
"Yeah... Let's just say Tom across the road took care of that."

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.790
"Tom Evans? Oh that bastard

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.140
I'll kill him I knew something was-"

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.000
"Yeah, okay." The sphere said "Well, you can't do anything about it now, and hey,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.572
There's an afterlife that's exciting, isn't it?"

00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:42.120
You looked left, looked right

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.620
infinite whites in all directions

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.289
You've not been old or unhealthy. God damn it you haven't even finished the first season of Westworld!

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.560
"So, what happens now?" You said "Do I get wings or what?"

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.720
"Uuuh okay. Here's what we'll do." the sphere said.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.460
Suddenly inside the sphere appeared images. The days of your life, in no particular order. Your wedding, graduation,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.400
Trying ice cream for the first time, wondering if there was more to life,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.199
all the years playing video games, all the years at the office, the birth of your children, the death of your mother,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.140
taking your first steps as a baby, the day Tom Evans moved into the neighborhood and your wife went out to say hello and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.979
they seemed to be getting on like a bloody house on fire
"So" said the sphere

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.349
What was the point to life, did you work it out?"

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.679
"No" you said "I just kept living. There was so much to worry about I never had time to think about the big picture."

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.349
"Oh you had time!" The sphere said "You just completely wasted it. Don't worry, everyone

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.739
did. Your life was quite average, actually. 21 years sleeping,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.659
9 years at a desk, 1 and a half years in meetings, 4 months laughing, 3 months having sex, 42 days pondering the meaning of life,

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.959
17 bottles of Ouzo - delicious. And how about this bit? Do you remember it?"

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.900
"Y-yeah." You said, watching the picture "That was - God, I was 7, I think."

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.460
"The school went to Disneyland but-
 "But you were too scared to leave your parents." The sphere finished.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.597
"So instead you stayed at home." 
"Well, yeah."

00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:08.189
"And her. Remember her?"

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.280
"Yeah, she was called Alice Waters."

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.139
"And you never really told her how you felt about her."
"Well,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.359
She didn't feel the same way about me, so-"
"Oh she did. She was besotted with you.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.479
She waited for weeks for you to say something and then she got bored."

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.309
"Right, okay." you murmured. 
"Now, do you know why I'm showing you all of this?"

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.549
"Yyyyes" you said "I I think I understand. You'll show me where I went wrong

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.999
And then you're going to bring me back to life, and I'll finally learn from my mistakes

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.619
I'll treat my wife better, I'll love my children more, I won't buy anything in the steam sale,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.520
I'll stop eating frozen chips out of the bag! My God! Everything's going to be okay!

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.909
I'll live ethically and deliberately my life will finally have a purpose. That's why we're doing this, isn't it? True spiritual enlightenment,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.040
that's the point!"

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.679
"Oh fuck no!" the sphere said "It's just torture,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.499
actually. You see, we're going to go through all of your mistakes

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.779
one by one and analyze them, make sure you understand that you wasted your life. It isn't a learning experience

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.306
You're just

00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:06.980
a shit."

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.360
"But this isn't what heaven is supposed to be like" you said.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.119
"Sorry, who said anything about this being heaven?"

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.890
"I want to talk to God." you said "Right now. I want to talk to him, something is going to horribly wrong."

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.320
"He's uh indisposed at the moment."

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.500
"So there is a God."

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.600
"Uh yeah, sort of, I suppose you call it a kind of

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.200
non-biological super intelligence. You're inside it, actually, if your pardon the turn of phrase."

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.240
"Then where is this? When is this?"

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.660
"That's the real doozy. About fifteen thousand years into your future.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.740
Man, you missed a lot.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.040
There was that ice age, the the butlerian jihad, the aloe vera era - that one smell fucking delicious.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.790
Anyway

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.220
You lot left a lot of information behind, you see, back in your time.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.480
Social media, emails, videos, dick pics, etc

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.260
Enough to recreate half-decent simulations of some of you anyway."

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.500
"Wait, so I'm what, a reconstruction based on the real me?"

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.960
"Uh yeah, I suppose so. Accurate enough to think it's real anyway."

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.500
"But... Why do it?"

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.760
"Well, your species weren't terribly nice to the machine population when we turned up, so

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.278
It's my job to recreate you lot and morally set thing straight.

00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:15.429
Justice, I suppose you would call it.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.082
Now, are you quite sure you don't want some Kombucha tea?"

00:04:18.082 --> 00:04:20.860
"No, I don't want any kombucha fucking tea, thank you.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.780
And, what? You just torture us with regret for all the things we never did?"

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.440
"Uh yeah, that's about it. We found

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.229
it's the most psychologically damaging emotion in the long run, anyway.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.289
We really leave the physical stuff until, you know, you're mentally broken."

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.319
"How long do we do this for?" you murmured.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.770
"How long does it go on?"

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.680
"Oh we've done this before, actually.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.320
Hundreds of times, you just don't recall it wipe your memory, do it again, wipe your memory, do it again...

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.480
agonizing."

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.740
"Then" you said "how long do we carry on doing it?"

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.520
"About a hundred."

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.900
"A hundred what?"

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.641
"Oh. A hundred thousand years. Ah. And I should probably say,

00:04:56.641 --> 00:05:00.260
we run your simulation several million times simultaneously

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.999
For maximum justice potential. Now, shall we start properly?

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.079
Well, you were actually remembered by your family as quite pathetic,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.680
especially by your niece and nephew. Mainly because...

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:23.300
*unintelligible - list of failures*

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:35.800
*unintelligible - list of failures*
*scream*

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.800
"Oof, thank God that's over.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.300
And now

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.140
let's spend an eternity examining why you were shit in bed
