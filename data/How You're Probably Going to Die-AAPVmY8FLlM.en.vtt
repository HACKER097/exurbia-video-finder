00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.640
The most common cause of death is called dying,
and it kills about 55 million of us each year.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.030
That’s about one South Africa or two hundred
star destroyers.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.059
And good news, it's your turn next because
you've just become a competitor in the suicide

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.070
Olympics.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.880
Bet you didn't even know that was a thing,
eh?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.680
The rules of the suicide Olympics are as follows:

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.630
First place goes to whoever gets themselves
killed in the most unlikely or unusual fashion,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.630
okay?

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.730
The winner gets a bilion dollars.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.189
Now this isn't Zimbabwe dollars or something,
this is hard, American moolah.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.250
Obviously if you win, you're dead, so you
don't get the money personally.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.250
Your family does.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.079
So, let's just pretend you give a shit about
your family for a minute.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.190
The twist is that it has to be an accident.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.149
You can't set it up in advance.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.089
So no flying a kite in a lightning storm or
playing whose gun is it anyway with a policeman

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.500
or something, it has to be an accident out
of your control.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.670
Now, if like me, you're balls to the wall
scared of flying you might think hey that's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.179
easy, I'll just fly crappy airlines, and wait
for something to go wrong, right?

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.179
Yyeeeeeeno.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.510
The odds of being in a fatal plane crash are
about 1 in eleven million meaning if you flew

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.920
every single day you've need to live about
30,000 years to actually get into an accident.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.170
So that's not gonna butter any parsnips is
it?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.630
Well, next best thing, become an astronaut.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.990
That's about a 1 in 100 chance of dying on
launch, that sounds a lot better, but considering

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.009
you'll need at least a master's degree, practically
perfect health, and testicles made entirely

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.649
of steel, maybe that might be a bit of a challenge.

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:19.649
All right?

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.420
Bungee jumping – 1 in 100,000

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.509
Mountain climbing?

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.149
Mm, about 1 in 1700.

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.520
Yeah, but in Nepal?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.700
how about 1 in 160.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.649
Actually, if you get above 6000m it's more
like 1 in 10.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.549
Oh holla, now we're talking.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:34.840
But maybe you think that's cheating.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.109
Normal people don't climb mountains.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.280
How about travel instead?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.450
About 1000 people are killed each year in
Mexico by scorpions,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.310
15,000 people are killed in India every year
by snakes,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.310
Or move to Africa.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.689
That's a hippo.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.000
Intimidating it isn't.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.020
Well yes it is actually.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.219
Hyppos belong from the pachyderm family, which
is in fact latin, for murder cow and during

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.579
a particularly bad year they can kill around
3000 people.

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.139
But still your best chance of dying is probably
just to....live?

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.079
Because we suck at it.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.829
Last century about a hundred million people
were killed by tobacco.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.149
Likewise, if you're fat, pardon me, a person
of weight, well, obesity killed about 300,000

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.260
people in the US last year.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.629
88,000 died by booze related stuff.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.010
Several hundred thousand to drug abuse,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.849
And on top of that, cancer kills about 1 in
7 of us,

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.280
Heart disease kills about half that,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.890
A stroke gets 1 in 23.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.849
All of this proving that probably everything
your scared of is very unlikely to actually

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:26.849
kill you.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.660
Chances are your death is going to be incredibly
boring . So, chin up, eh?

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.060
Actually, while we're at it, what about the
odds of you just being born to begin with?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.480
Well, according to Dr. Ali Binazir who did
the math on this one, pretty like low?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.409
Assuming your parents socialised like
normal humans, The probability of them meeting

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.050
was about 1 in 20,000

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.490
The odds that they even have a kid, given
global trends?

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.680
About 1 in 2,000

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.120
Now assuming they did meet, and your mum thought
your dad wasn't a jerk, and he managed to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.760
ignore the fact that she considered the star
wars prequels better than the originals, and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.129
they actually did the sexy times, the
odds that you would be born, of that sperm

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.040
hooking up with that egg – in particular
are about 1 in 400.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.040
Quadrillion.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.019
And that's not even the half of it, because before
the egg, before your mum and dad met,

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.770
there is of course all of
your ancestors who also had to get laid, and

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.110
just taking that about 100,000 generations
back, we're talking about 10 to the power

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.629
of 45,000 that they would all meet, but now
we have to calculate the odds of every single

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.750
one of those 100,000 meetings between your
ancestors would work out, and those sperms

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.120
and eggs would match up, well that comes out
at about 1 in ten to the power of 2,640,000

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.769
which is a number so big you can't even, well
you know like a bag of m&amp;ms?

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.380
Well, it's a few trillion of those.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.140
Timesed by all the particles in the universe.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.320
Multipled by Jabba the hut's waist measurement.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.849
With a cherry on top.

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.650
It's big all right.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.099
All in all, flying is pretty safe, your death
is going to be boring, and your birth was

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.640
rarer than a fucking mewtwo

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.170
Au Revoir
