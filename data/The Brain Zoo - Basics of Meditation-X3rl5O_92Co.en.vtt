00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.580
This is the Brain Zoo. Where the brain animals live.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.960
There are some that you may recognize, such as:

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.580
Who is always telling you how everything will go wrong,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.200
and you're shit, and no one ever loved you anyway.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.900
There's:

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.280
Who insists that effort is boring, so don't do it.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.600
Who recommends you end your own life.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.120
And then there's:

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.940
The moose, who suggests at all times, that you should be doing more ketamine.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.900
Might be, um...

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.440
*Clears throat*

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.480
Might be a bit, specific, that last one...

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.720
Anyway, these guys are usually hiding under the surface, telling you, what's what,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.120
but is there a way to quiet them down?

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.980
Well...

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.660
Maybe...

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.620
Yes.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.280
Imagine your mind is a big concert.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.900
There is, the:

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.780
Who does all of the watching, and listening.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.260
This is the core of your mind, right?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.220
Just pure awareness.  You with a capital Y̲.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.220
But then there's the:

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.220
They represent all the sensations in your mind, good, and bad, and everything flowing in.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.580
Sometimes you're eating a lovely sandwich, or hanging out with someone you think is a bit special,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.360
and the orchestra plays a happy number.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.200
Other times you get fired, or some

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.500
𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐩𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐮𝐠𝐚𝐫 𝐢𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐭𝐞𝐚!

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.740
And now the orchestra is playing quite a different tune, indeed.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.380
The point is that the orchestra never stops.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.600
They're always playing something or other in your mind, about

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.700
what's happened,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.540
happening,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.920
or what will happen.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.240
They never shut up. We're constantly swimming in thoughts.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.900
And sometimes, the audience starts thinking, they are the orchestra.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.200
that is the root of the problem with fear, and unpleasant emotions, it seems.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.880
We forget that:

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.880
The funny thing is, that there are only a hundred chairs in the brain concert.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.900
Now, on those days in life, when there's nothing to worry about, and stuff's going well,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.880
maybe it's 90% audience, and 10% orchestra.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.400
There's nothing to fight against, you've got control of your own head.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.820
But the real danger time is when you're afraid, or pissed off, like when you have to do something scary,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.540
and the audience starts trying to run away.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.860
But of course the orchestra doesn't like it when you try to run away.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.860
So more move in, and play louder,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.800
AND LOUDER,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.260
until the whole concert is 95% orchestra, and 5% poor audience,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.780
and you lose control of your mind!

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.760
Your bubble of awareness shrinks,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.720
and Captain Dickhead McTerror fills the vacuum for as long as you let him.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.840
So, what to do, then.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.400
Well, who's really in control here?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.300
The orchestra?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.440
Or the audience.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.620
Your conscious mind,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.640
or the sensations inside it.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.740
Well it's the audience, right?  They pay for the concert.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.380
That's who everyone is here for, the part of your mind just observing everything.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.740
If the audience don't like what's playing they can just listen, for a while.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.840
They're not personally responsible.  They didn't write the music!

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.140
Besides, they know it's only music, anyway.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.520
...pretty much.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.280
Reminding yourself over, and over, that mind nasties, are just noise.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.260
Fear is just a shit orchestra.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.660
And that watching it, instead of getting drawn in, is a very, very good way to kill it.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.180
Same goes for all the other little bastards, in the brain zoo.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.700
Meditation doesn't have to be performed sitting down cross-legged with an incense stick up your arse.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.980
It's equally doable,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.660
right before you're about to get up on stage, or do something else you're bothered by.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.360
It's the mindset, right?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.680
Observing, rather than getting drawn in, and freaking out.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.820
This isn't easy to do, and humans have been working on it for thousands of years.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.300
This starts with remembering that

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.840
thoughts and sensations are only noise, in the first place.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.200
They aren't You.  You with a capital Y̲, that is.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.140
The audience isn't the orchestra.  If shit music is playing, they can just listen, and not pay.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.440
And what happens, when people stop paying for bad orchestras?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.380
Well they go out of business, eventually.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.460
Until it's just one guy left on stage, playing crappy trombone.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.780
And the only person he's harming, is himself.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.820
Isn't that right, Clive?

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.000
...knobhead.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.820
Ah!  One more thing.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.140
If you really wanted to find out where that sense of "Youness" is coming from in the first place,

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.960
the audience,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.180
well, let's go on a little mental adventure.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.380
Well first let's forget your life, and identity for a second, right?

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.880
Because that isn't really you.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.920
Then let's try to ignore all the sensations in your head.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.020
All your desires, and daydreams, and phobias, and memories,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.380
𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘉𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘩 𝘱𝘦𝘰𝘱𝘭𝘦,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.080
because that isn't really you either.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.780
And let's just go right to the back of your mind, where 'real you' lives.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.940
But when we get there, it's just empty space, right?

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.720
There's no sign of a self, or a real identity.  There's no one home.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.060
Well there isn't one.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.040
Not if you take everything else away.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.620
I hope, like me, you find that

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.660
and I'm not sure what that means.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.300
But sometimes it's nice to have a nice good old look at the wiring under the board, now and again.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.540
To remind yourself that we are very, very weird machines.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.260
Most of the time we just listen to the orchestra and do whatever it tells us to.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.000
But with a bit of determination and practice,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.540
plenty of people have gotten good at telling their audience to stay seated when something awful is going on.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.200
Lots of links below about how to get started if you're interested.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.220
I know this sounds a bit cult-y, but it isn't.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.200
It's basically just recycled Buddism, without the frilly stuff.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.480
But anyway, that is the idea of meditation, really.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.080
To get you to a point where you can say,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.860
👋🐢 "Goodbye Anxity Squid!"

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.740
👋🐢 "Hasta la vista Depression Horse!"

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.120
And, "Alright, you compelling little drug moose,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.760
👉😎👉 let's go get some FUCKING ketamine!"

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.080
['eyyy, captioner here.]

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.020
[Nice long outro slide for me to shill out for Exurb1a,  nice.]

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.060
[Patreon link is in the description, and up there as an annotation button.]

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.020
[Go donate to the $60 tier.  Have him make some guided meditation audio files.]

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.000
[Or don't.  It's still your money, as always.]

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.040
[Alright, see you all!  👋🐢]

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.960
[Hope finals are going well, if you're taking them!]

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.000
[Or just life and such if you're watching this later!]
