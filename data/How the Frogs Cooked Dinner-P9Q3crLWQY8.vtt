00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.799
one day a scorpion wanted to cross a

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.720
river so it approached a frog for help

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.639
i'd like to the frog said but if i let

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.480
you get on my back you'll sting me of

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.559
course i wouldn't the scorpion said that

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.880
would only kill us both and so the frog

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.880
let the scorpion onto its back they swam

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.880
out onto the river once they reached the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.960
middle of the river the scorpion stand

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.279
the frog the frog called out why did you

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.920
do that now we'll both die it's in my

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.400
nature the scorpion said as they both

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.560
began to slip below the water bound for

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.640
muddy graves on the bottom of that dark

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.040
riverbed that neither cheered nor

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.200
commiserated nor delighted in the slings

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.120
and arrows of the amoral unit hold up

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.480
there forefront the frog said the frog

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.920
had been up all night at a frankfurt

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.360
rave and was still so full of disco

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.039
biscuits that his system could fight off

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.800
the poison for a few moments longer you

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.800
must be very wise if you're so aware of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.480
your own impulses like that you bet the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.160
scorpion said and you must be very

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.160
clever and worldly if you lied to me

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.239
like that my intellectuals are german my

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.760
lingerie is french the scorpion said

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.440
then how come you're not clever and wise

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.280
enough to realize you can resist your

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.879
own nature why would i want to the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.559
scorpion asked because you haven't just

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.080
killed me you've killed yourself you

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.080
could have waited 20 seconds then stung

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.080
me when we got back to land ah the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.600
scorpion said that this was guaranteed

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.360
to work you can't blame me for being a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.680
profiteer it's the main character of

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.280
scorpions no it isn't the frog said you

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.479
just so lacking character that the only

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.080
thing you know how to do is ruin the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.159
efforts of others and kill yourself in

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.479
the process the scorpion lit a cigarette

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.080
as they continue to sink and said eh and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.360
you know the frog said the most

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.799
insulting part isn't that you've done

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.400
something stupid it's that you've done

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.920
something stupid and you're so afraid of

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.680
just apologizing that you've concocted

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.040
an entire infantile ad-hoc belief system

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.400
around your own shortcomings full of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.159
enough cognitive dissonance to make the

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.680
trojan horse blush you think you're

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.200
clever trying to convince everyone that

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.880
profiteering off greed is the way of the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.159
world but you're dumb because you don't

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.520
even realize you're dependent on the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.560
rest of us for there to even be things

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.159
to profiteer off of ah the scorpion said

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.240
either you die a hero or live long

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.840
enough to become the no the frog said

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.439
the world isn't fundamentally unfair the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.280
world isn't anything it's just full of

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.719
creatures that make it so you're the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.000
problem convincing yourself everything

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.000
is futile just so you can give them to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.280
your cynical zero-sum game impulses

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.200
which you could choose to assess and

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.680
discard at any time and then things

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.440
wouldn't be unfair idiocy is passive it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.280
takes a special kind of idiot to inflict

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.599
their idiocy on someone else the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.319
scorpion considered this then said [ __ ]

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.560
you [ __ ] you said the frog [ __ ] you said

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.910
the scorpion no [ __ ] you said the frog

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.440
no [ __ ] you said the scorpion

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.840
[Music]

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.599
[ __ ] you no [ __ ] you said the frog we're

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.200
all selfish sometimes but most of us are

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.640
ashamed of it we don't make selfishness

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.000
of virtue in some cheap attempt to trick

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.519
the only idiots who believe that kind of

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.280
nonsense just so we can take a few more

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.040
spoils from the world for ourselves i

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.560
didn't even want to be in a fable i

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.239
applied for a greek paradox but they

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.000
only take cute animals now i have to get

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.680
remembered for this [ __ ] what's even the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.200
moral put up with vicious idiots who

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.680
want to ruin the world they can't help

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.760
it how is that my fault just apologize

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.000
and i'll forgive you even now even at

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.319
the end oh i never apologize the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.400
scorpion said why because it's not in my

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.800
nature the frog slipped beneath the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.560
water it gave a few desperate gasps then

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.560
died the scorpion slipped beneath the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.080
water and did not die because scorpions

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.760
can survive for up to 48 hours

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.959
underwater it was so stupid it didn't

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.120
realize it could have gotten over the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.120
river by itself it watched the frog's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.360
motionless body a while on the riverbed

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.879
and meditated on death and futility and

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.959
wondered if it should feel responsible

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.120
for all this it thought to itself and

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.879
how can frogs die better than facing

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.120
fearful odds for the ashes of their

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.959
fathers and the temples of their gods

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.560
which wasn't the scorpion's line but it

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.959
would tell everyone that it was on

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.560
balance it decided not a bad day a

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.159
number of frogs had been watching the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.920
scene and were waiting for the scorpion

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.239
when it waddled back out of the water

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.640
why did you do that they asked it's in

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.720
my nature the scorpion said wait one

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.799
frog said we're altruists this is a new

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.640
concept to us what do you mean ah the

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.319
scorpion said you can't blame a creature

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.480
for reckless egotism if it's just what

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.879
they do the frogs pondered this whose

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.879
fault is it then uh the scorpion said

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.560
everyone else is for being compassionate

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.640
of course they're the real problem in

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.560
the animal kingdom why this changes

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.480
everything the frog said we'll switch to

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.000
the new paradigm immediately as a thank

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.599
you for this revelation would you like

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.599
to join us for dinner so we can discuss

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.519
guiltless self-interest further in fact

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.200
bring all your friends incapable of

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.879
practicing kindness but more than happy

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.640
to take it from others the scorpion and

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.799
its many associates accepted the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.880
invitation that evening the frogs

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.120
prepared a delicious meal of olives and

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.880
bread and wine and cheese and every

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.359
scorpion in the forest roasted over a

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.359
massive fire
