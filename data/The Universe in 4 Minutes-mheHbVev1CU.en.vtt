00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.720
Alright, welcome to the universe.
We will start with Tyrion Lannister of physics -

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.500
The Planck Length

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.560
Which is the smallest thing you can sensibly talk about.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.500
Probably...

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Next stop - we will lose our subatomic partical virginity

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.200
and meet our first neutrino.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200
Dont worry, she's lovely

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.700
and she has a lots of friends.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.200
There are around 65 billion of them passing through just 1 square cm of Earth every second.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.000
Up next - we bump into quarks. These come in several flavours:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.400
Up, Down, Strange, Charm, Top, Bottom and
Banana

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.800
These are about as close to the building blocks of nature as we have managed to get so far.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.000
Next stop -  we get to the A-list celebritites of subatomic world

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Derek Neutron and Barbara Proton

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.500
Usually they engage in three ways:

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.400
With Carmen Electron and a kinky arrangement  known as atoms

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.300
Funny thing about subatomical particles:

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.500
Sometimes they behave as waves,
other times as particles

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.200
Depending on how they are feeling and whether or not are they on their period

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.500
Which brings us to some more celebrities you have heard of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.300
Such as Helium, Hydrogen, Carbon and Cesium

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.800
All of this stuff so far and everything in the universe

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.200
Is controlled by 4 forces:

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.700
The Strong Force, which generally binds quarks, protons and neutrons together.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.200
Then there's weak force, which regulates radioactive decay.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.000
The electromagnetic force, which holds atoms and molecules together

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.500
Basically...

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.600
And finally - gravity. He was the promiscuous hussie of physics and regulates everything else

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600
Like universes.
But we'll get to there later

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.700
All the stuff is contained in a neat little package

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.300
called The Standard Model and is about as close to a theory of everything we've managed to get so far.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
Generally, the little stuff comes under a title Quantum Physics

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.200
And a big stuff, to which we get to in a moment, is known as Relativistic Physics

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.000
Scientists are working very hard on getting the two of them to move in together

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But currently they have severe commitment issues

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
A little further up we get to the code of life

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.100
Deoxyribonucleic acid, also known as

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.000
DNA (AAA!)

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
DNA is made of a sneeze called

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.700
ATCG

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.500
Or Adenine,  Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.000
Depending on how these are arranged

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.200
You can get anything from Ebola virus to Papyrus, to the German Iris to Miley Cyrus

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.700
Up some more, we get the cells

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.000
Some top favourites including

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.600
Red Blood, White Blood, Dendritic and soft

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.200
The next level above that should be familiar

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.700
This is where we find raindrops, Blue Whales, hakisaks, Redtube, the human race

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.000
as well as Norway

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Out a little further

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.800
Now we are looking down on all of human history

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.600
Including all of our insecurities, morgage repayments and ex-sexual partners

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600
Which reminds me Natasha

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.100
You're a b*tch!

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.300
Moving on we get to the eight planets and 146 moons of our Solar system

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.200
which doesn't count Pluto

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.000
Because you are not a planet, Pluto

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.900
You are done mate!
It's over! Yeah.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.600
Then there's the Sun, which is a four and a half billion year old burning ball of Hydrogen and Helium

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.900
Several billion years from now

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900
The Sun will rage quit and turn into a red giant

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900
Gobbling whatever is left of a planet by then

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.800
Out again, we find the Milky Way.
The Milky Way contains at least a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.800
100 billion stars

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.000
Stars can be by themselves, or orbiting each other

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.600
called a Binary Star System

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.900
Or occasional group of three, which is called a Trinary/Ternary

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.100
Or MÃ©nage a Star

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.000
And that's not all

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
There's also Nebulae, which is a little starry womb where a lots of stars are born

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.200
Moons, which either come from planets or are a random floating matter

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.600
And comets, meteors and a million other types of astronomical bodies

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.000
that there simply isn't time to talk about

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
At the center of our galaxy

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.600
And lots of other galaxies, are black holes

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.000
These are enourmous wells of gravity that suck matter in

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And distort thyme (time)

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.200
Fun fact: If you'd hold your breath while falling into a black hole

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.800
You would die, obviously

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.700
And then there's the rest of the Universe

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.500
The Milky Way, our galaxy, is one of a list of hundred billion galaxies

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.900
Each one prettier than the last

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.400
Since there are a 100 billion galaxies with at least a 100 billion stars in them

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.800
That means there are at least
10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (do the math) stars

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.000
In the Universe

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.600
The Universe itself, as far as we are aware, is about 95 billion lightyears across

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.600
Or to put it in another way.
If you are travelling with the speed of light

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
300 000 kilometers per second

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.100
It would take you 95 000 000 000 years to get from one side to the other

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.700
Except for the fact that the Universe is expanding

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.400
And the expansion is getting faster

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.100
Which literally makes no sense

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.200
And a... yeah.
That's... that's about it really.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.700
Oh! Except there might be

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.200
Parallel universes

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.500
And hidden dimensions of space

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400
And we completely forgot about time

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.000
The Universe began, if you can call it that, about 14 billion years ago

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.400
The first few galaxies turned up a few hundred million years later.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400
A few hundred millions after that we get the Milky Way

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.000
Another few and you've got a very young Earth

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.700
Then oceans

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.600
Then life a bit later

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.200
Reptiles

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.000
Dinosaurs

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.300
Game over for dinosaurs.
Sorry chaps.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.600
Evolution of hominids

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.000
And finally all of our bullsh*t

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.800
Here...

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.000
Or here
Or....

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.000
Here, maybe
it's...

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It's kinda hard to tell, because we are so insignificant

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.500
Anyway

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.000
Nothing means anything and we all are going to die.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Bye then!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
