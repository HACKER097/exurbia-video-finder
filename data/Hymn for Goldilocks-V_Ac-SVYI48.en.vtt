00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
There is a universe. No-one knows it's name,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.240
where gravity wasn't strong enough to bind matter together,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.540
and no stars formed.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.340
And because no stars formed, no stars exploded.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.220
And because no stars exploded, no planets came about.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.640
And because no planets came about, there was no life.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.440
There's another universe. No-one knows it's name,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.620
where gravity was strong enough and did light the stars and planets came about and boy, they were gorgeous,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.880
planets in perpetual winter,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.220
planets in perpetual summer,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.760
planets that could rival the Garden of Eden

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.800
and no bloody snakes!

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.400
And on one of them, eventually, complex life evolved

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.400
and one of the species developed large brains

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.400
and learned things like manners and dabing,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.880
and they looked up at the stars and wondered what they were doing here.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.880
You call them octopuses, I suppose.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.880
Gosh, they were clever, (for octopuses),

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.880
And one of them, several million years in,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.020
almost wrote something in ink on the sea floor,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540
a message to its friend.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.900
And the message almost read;

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.500
"Hi! How are you?"

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.120
And a few millennia later, space folded back on itself and,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.020
you get the idea.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.120
Goodbye octopi.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.060
There's another universe where life formed on every planet

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.060
in every solar system, and it was carbon based,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.040
it was silicone based

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.420
and it was made of crystals and water and plasma,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.320
it was made of quantum fields and light,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.320
and everything was alive, everything was doing a boogie,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.320
and it was everybody's birthday, everyday

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.020
(relatively)

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.020
and everyone got presents,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.500
and they had over a trillion languages,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.460
some written down, some only spoken, some conducted telepathically,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.460
and they built a galactic civilisation together,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.620
as a perfect unity,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.880
sharing stories, sharing technology, speaking a common tongue,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.440
understanding everything about how the cosmos had been put together.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.280
And finally, when everything was sorted,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.580
the galaxies were arranged into perfect geometric formations,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.600
transmitting pure love, and wisdom, and birthday greetings

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.960
to all species in the universe, for all time.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.620
Paper cuts never happened,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.900
coke came in glass bottles,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900
no-one even remembered the word for war,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.200
everything was beautiful, and nothing hurt.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.520
And yet, for a quirk in their evolution,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.840
because resources weren't scarce enough on the planets these species developed on,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.720
not a single creature in the universe was conscious.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.040
Food was eaten, and no-one enjoyed it.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.580
Movies were released, and there was no laughing, or crying.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.580
No-one chuckled at a joke.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.160
Ever.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.620
Space collapsed back on itself, eventually,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.620
and there hadn't been a single moment of sentience

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.620
in the entire history of creation.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.100
There's another universe, where the strong force is too strong and the weak force is too weak

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.360
and nothing forms.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.860
Another, where life develops too late and the stars have all gone beyond the light boundry

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.380
and there's nothing to even see.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.020
Another with too many dimensions.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.080
Another with not enough.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080
Another where time goes in the opposite direction,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.800
and species begin as gods, and wind backwards to cells,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.260
and never learn to survive.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.020
Another that only lasts milliseconds,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.320
and collapses in on itself,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.360
and heads straight back

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.220
to oblivion.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.200
And that's how it just might be,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.800
across all possible universes,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.440
across all possible spacetimes.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.100
Problems with the laws of nature,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.400
not enough resources,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.980
missteps in evolution.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.680
An atlas of dead-ends.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Then again, there is one exception.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.820
There's another universe,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.600
a big one,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.460
where life is rare,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.400
where intelligent life is very rare indeed,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.900
the stars are very distant from each other,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.540
the laws of nature are very complex,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.540
it's extremely lonely for any species developing,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.380
and most never even develop at all,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.980
but somewhere,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.820
we believe,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.560
is a planet where the oceans are vast,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.840
and the climate is varied.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.800
Where the smartest species on the planet may have developed just the right mix of ambition and kindness.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.120
And if you were to travel there,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.780
to this unbelievably rare statistical anomaly,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.380
to this impossibly lucky planet,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.280
where evolution,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.020
biology,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.620
chemistry,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.340
nae, the laws of physics themselves

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.500
have come together to create sentient intelligent life,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.960
you may be able to catch the native inhabitants

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.840
singing for joy.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.200
The one impossibly lucky, and rare position they find themselves in.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.000
It is a chant of gratitude,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.520
a ritual of showing appreciation for ending up in perhaps the one universe,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.940
in the one solar system,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.640
on the one planet with all the basic ingredients for intelligent, conscious life

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.640
it is a hymn for Goldilocks,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.920
sung at all times of the day,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.880
in every language,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.980
on every continent.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.400
And it sounds something like...

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.600
*notification sound*

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.840
*buzz buzz*

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.340
*notification sound*

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.420
*notification sound*

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.820
*buzz buzz*

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.040
*notification sound*

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.460
*notification sound*

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.580
*notification sound*

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.460
*notification sound*

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.840
*constant notifications*

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.420
FFFFFFFFFF

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.500
FUUUUCK
