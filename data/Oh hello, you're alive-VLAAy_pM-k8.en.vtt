00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
Oh hello, you're alive. Great, welcome to
the world, have a seat because you can't walk yet.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.240
You're gonna spend the next few
years in the psychedelic world of colors

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.870
that make no sense but it's alright
because you can pee yourself and somebody

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.120
will probably sort it out for you but
don't get used to it, soon they'll be

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.670
expecting you to use the toilet, so make
the most of it, and not long after that

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.609
you have to go to a building where they'll make
you learn stuff and prove you know it like

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.199
times tables and the alphabet and whatnot.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.359
Maybe you still think you are the center
of the world and you can probably get

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.000
away with that for a while - some people
do their entire lives - but eventually

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.400
you're going to start pissing other kids off so
you probably gonna have to learn some

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.510
humility soon, too.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.869
Got it? Good, all right. Then you're gonna
go to another building where the tests are a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.600
bit harder and the subjects are more
intense. They try to teach you stuff like

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.840
trigonometry and iambic pentameter without
ever actually explaining what you can use

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.570
it for but don't worry, just memorize it
and spit it out and forget it the second

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.420
you walk out of the exam hall. By now
you're probably getting weird urges to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.360
do stuff to your classmates that you never
really wanted to do before and now

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.280
you're gonna have to play a game for
the rest of your life where you really

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.950
want this kind of closeness with people
but sometimes not everybody feels

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.320
mutually, so you're going to have to hide it.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.829
Welcome to the world of dating and
body language and sex. Yeah, you're gonna like the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.350
last one, it's going to dictate your life
and most of the films you watch and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.230
book you read for some time to come  
whether you realize it or not.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.470
Oh you're finished spitting out all that
rote memorization well great let's go

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.309
to university.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.010
You need to if you want to earn lots of
money which is obviously very important

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.560
because well, well it just is shut up!

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.159
Look, everyone's happy when they're rich. Pick
a subject, not the humanities you idiot,

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.330
something real like law or maths. I didn't spent 18
years raising fucking philosophy major

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.630
cogito ergo broke all the time. Oh you
finished? Great, well it's off to the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.390
companies for you then. Tell them you're a
people person and you have excellent

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.119
organizational skills and you work well in a
team.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.000
Don't mention your actual passions for
landscape gardening or music, they don't give a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.600
shit.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.810
just come off as generic as possible,
stick it out for about 30 years, you'll make

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.860
good money in time.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.560
Only the sex thing is probably getting a
little empty by now and you're craving

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.700
some kind of actual connection with the
opposite sex or same sex if that's your thing.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.430
Jesus, you thought getting people to take
their clothes off is difficult, you try

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.950
finding a partner to fall in love with. And
even then, what if they get bored or you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.189
get bored or they go off with the milkman or
something, well sorry you're just gonna

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.280
have to risk it like everyone else. Like
life, actually.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.060
Some people are dead by your age but
you're not. No, you're still sad in a pit

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.540
of your own mediocrity feeling dull and
stepped on by life, standing on a rock

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.960
that's spinning at 9,000 miles an hour around
a gas giant in an infinite universe, a product of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.290
13 billion years of cosmic evolution but
no, no, definitely you carry on being

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.970
bored and feeling

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.190
like crap. And you now you feel worse
because you know how great you should

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.530
feel about everything, amazed and happy
all the time

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.890
and yet you still feel like shit. Well,
that's biology. Well, maybe your friend's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.130
getting rich or getting married or getting
pregnant or something and you're poor and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.960
single and maybe you don't want kids,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.720
it doesn't matter what Carl Sagan says,
you don't feel any sense of wonder

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.950
at all, you feel like shit,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.530
you don't want eloquent prose about how
beautiful the cosmos is you want money

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.630
to live comfortably or you want to be in
love

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.840
and maybe you want children. Try books, there's
quite a few dead guys who are willing to

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.240
claim they can explain what you're doing
here and how you can be happy but loads of

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.720
them just contradict each other and to
be honest it all comes down to you.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.450
You're going to have to decide whether
you believe in God or want to eat meat

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.510
or support abortion or feel that life
has intrinsic meaning and whatever you

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.690
do people, will shit on your opinions and
tell you you're delusional.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.560
Sorry, it's a game with no winners. And
now you're old and maybe you've got

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.200
money and maybe you haven't, same with a
partner and child, and now you're two

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.360
steps from death and you spend a lot of time
thinking about what you could have done

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.600
and Jennifer Smith in the fields behind
your parents' house when you were both 17

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.400
and how you should've said I love you

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.010
and instead you said look I'm sorry I'm
just not in the best place right now,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.480
come on, it's getting cold.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.540
Well, no use thinking about it now. Jennifer is
probably old and doddery just like you

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.580
are. Not much time left.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.670
Well, I guess i'll just do it all again
differently the next time.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.360
Oh, there - there isn't a next time? Oh that - that was it?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.080
Shit, I'd wish I had known because if I'd
known that this was the one chance I

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.600
have to live as a talking monkey in
space at the best point in history as

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.040
the smartest species on the planet

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.530
using fucking magic on a daily basis
like the internet and jet planes and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.050
smartphones with access to all human
knowledge at my fingertips and the

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.360
chance to talk about how cool being
alive is I might have not worried so much

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.510
about what other people thought and their shitty
lives, and I might have just spent what little

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.269
time there was making good art or doing good science or falling in love or

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.739
just not being a dick.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.790
Oh well, if only I'd known. Which I did
but i just don't really want to think

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.510
about it.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.890
Oh humm, so it goes.
