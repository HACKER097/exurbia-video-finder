00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A train is traveling from West to East at a speed of 300 km/h.

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:09.055
The driver applies the brake producing a deceleration of 1.4 m/s^2 in Newtons.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
How hard will the man in carriage 7 mash his face into the seat in front of him

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.095
and relise most of the problems in his life are created not by external circumstances,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.070
but his own repeated self-sabotage?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.080
Are human tears primarily composed of:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a) water

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:25.000
b) antibodies

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.000
c) a quiet admission that all of our plans and dreams will eventually turn to forgotten dust

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.000
d) salt

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Daniel gets salty at criticism, and admits he is wrong about something: never

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In years, how long will it be before he alienates all of his friends with this behaviour

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and finds himself entirely alone?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Rachel has chosen to remain alone at home for the evening and drink two litres of red wine.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Please identify the correct chemical formula for consumable alcohol. Is it:

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a) C2H6O

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
b) C2H5OH

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
c) The 17th time this year Rachel has attempted to solve an issue by

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
escaping it internally, simultaneously knowing at some point, however painful,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
she will have to confront whatever it is that went wrong and why.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If the y axis of this graph is a sense of purpose,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the x axis is the course of a human lifetime,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
please explain this result's significance:

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Alice and Pierre are having significant disagreement

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Pierre says: Why doesn't Obi-Wan Kenobi remember R2D2 in Star Wars Episode IV?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Alice says: No he did,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because, like, remember when he calls him "my little friend"?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Yeah, but he said he'd never owned a droid before

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Because R2D2, was Anakin's

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Please study figure 66 of the rest of the world not giving the slightest shit

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And relatedly, please study figure 72 of the world before you were borned and the world after you're gone

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and the world after everybody is gone

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Then please study figure 97 depicting some kind of lucrative interspecies' business venture

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
don't pretend you've got something better to be doing, you haven't

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
besides,... shut up!.. They're cute.
35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Is this angle:

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Is this angle: a) acute

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Is this angle: b) obtuse

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Is this angle: c)reflex

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Is this angle: d) the hug we desperately wish we could ask for

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but have convinced ourselves that the pain of existence must be carried alone on our backs forever and ever.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Ava and James sometimes interact digitally.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This month James has responded: 4, 3, and 7 days after's Ava's messages

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
so as to give the impression he is uniterested

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
despite being infatuated with her.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
What is James' median reply time and why he live miserably ever after?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Authur knows people who are nice to him, and people he likes.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Please explain why the only people he pushes away

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Are the few who occupy this intersection.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
An intersection is a point where two lines cross over.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Will and Claire intersect on a street.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.000
Claire is thinking:

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.000
"Do you know that i still love you that i will always love you that i was never as happy as when things were good between us

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.000
and i wish it could've worked and i'm just so sorry."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.070
Will is thinking:

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
"Not a day go by and i don't remember your little and large kindnessess, when i don't remember the new hights

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.000
of happiness, when we both climbed together and how sure we were it could never go wrong until it all went wrong and i'm just so sorry."

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.000
The lions will not intersect, again.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.000
Why are humans like this?

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.000
This year Amelia has suffered a death in the family, a breakup, and several other personal crises.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Calculate her remaining resistance to completely losing it when Christopher says:

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.000
"Hey, you look sad. Have you tried going for a run?"

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
"Have you tried paleo diet?"

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
"hAvE yOu TrIeD nOt bEiNg sAd?"

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
"Meh meh meh meh meh meh meh ahhhhhh"

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
A pine cone is a canonical fruit of the pine tree. It isn't sentinent, but

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
it also doesn't suffer for possessing sentience.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Therefore, would you rather live as:

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
a) a pine cone

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
b) a pine cone or

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
c) a pine cone

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
A pine cone experience neither shame,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
A pine cone experience neither shame, anxiety

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
A pine cone experience neither shame, anxiety, nor the long months that turn grey and numb for no conceivable reason.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Using only the terms gnaa and aahhahah explain what a nice condition it must be to be a pine cone.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
A pine cone is traveling from west to east at a speed of 300 kilometeres per hour if the driver applies

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the brake even if the pine cone bops its head even if the pine cone gets home that night to find

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
its house burned down or his life in ruins, even if Octalon

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Octalon: Custodian of the seven hell realms, manifests in the sky and begins annihilating entire

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
continents with beams of antimatter fired straight out of his ass.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Please explain why the pine cone will witness and bear these things with ease

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and experience no self-contradition, no sadness but merely boundless calm.
82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
For extra marks, please explain why any diety or evolutionary process would curse a species like humans

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
with a brain just enough to regconize its fucked up but not smart enough to stop

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
fucking up, and if happiness is your answer, will you please show your workings

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And if happiness is your answer, will you please show your workings

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and if.....

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
yeah.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
(be a pine cone bois)
