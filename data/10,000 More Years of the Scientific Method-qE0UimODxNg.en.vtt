00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.620
It's funny, isn't it?

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.980
We got all of this technology,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.400
we've got all of these clever machines, but if anyone actually asks, like, "how does any of it work?"

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.080
"At all?"

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.540
often the best reply you'll generally get is:

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.040
"Uh, yeah, well, probably someone built a box, and a wizard spluffed in it."

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.980
"And now it's magic, and that's how technology works."

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.900
"Everything's just made of wizard jizz."

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.180
And that's cool, that's cool -- but yeah,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.840
I just want to put a bit of an alternate answer out there -- that, like,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.360
yeah, technology is really complex, and the world is really complex,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.200
but overall, as it happens,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.320
actually...

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.780
The world isn't wizard jizz, technology's not magic,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.720
It's just scientists on acid, or applied mathematics.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.500
And every piece of technology, from satellites to shoes,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.420
Started in someone's fucking head. For example:

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.680
Segways -- not magic,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.860
Fizzy Cola -- not magic,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.360
Spacey science place -- not magic,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180
Magic marker -- not magic.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.840
It all just relies on foundational physical principles,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.440
Which we'll briefly discuss...

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.620
...Now.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.560
Hey, this sure keeps time good, right? Is it clockwork or what?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.420
Is it just tiny dragons all tapping their talons to EDM?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.620
No. It's quartz.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.480
We know if you electrify quartz, it puts out regular vibrations.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.240
And we know 32,768 of these vibrations is a second.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.500
So if you build a circuit that counts these vibrations, you can keep accurate time.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.620
And you just multiply these together until you get hours, days, and years.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.260
All thanks the little white crystals that aren't magic.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.860
Hey, not all that shabby. Is this some kind of wizardry?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.740
Nope, just good fucking science and piezo electricity.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.860
Or, er, yeah... Computers -- that has to be magic, right?

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.060
No. Get sand, purify sand, make silicon ingot,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.340
Make them wafer thin, do some fancy ion shit,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.800
And etching, electroplating, layering, and stuff --

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.900
And now what you've got is a little slab of silicon packed with transistors,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.080
Which are really just tiny little electricity gates.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.220
And you put them all together in such a way that they form an electronic mind,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.100
Consisting usually of stuff what goes in,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.000
Control thing,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.860
Thinking thing,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.980
Stuff what remembers shit,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.200
And stuff what comes out.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.640
A computer is just a little prison for electrons, where we train them to solve problems really quickly,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.180
And this all relies on the principles of subatomic physics,

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.560
Meaning that the most common use of quantum mechanics in the 21st century

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.640
Is undeniably,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.540
Most likely,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.480
Demonstrably,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.700
PORNOGRAPHY.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.340
How does that fly? It's simple, right?

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.160
Air under wings makes the wing glide, right?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.820
Throw in a big fucking spinning thing, right?

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.600
And if not, maybe some wizardry?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.140
No.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.540
Flight's a result of a difference in pressure above the wing versus below the wing.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.940
And the cool thing is that if you make sure the pressure is higher below the wing than above,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.020
Then lo, yo --

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.400
That's flight, right?

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.420
Yeah, also, what the hell is an engine?

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.040
Well, internal combustion is essentially the process of turning fuel into motion

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.500
Using fucking explosions.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.900
In a four-stroke engine gas and air go into the engine,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.240
And the gas and air is squeezed into an itty-bitty space,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240
A little spark starts a little explosion, forcing the piston to move,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.740
Then the excess gas is released,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.980
And that energy is turned into rotational motion using a crankshaft.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.100
And this is generally thanks to gasoline, which is in turn thanks to dead plants from swamps millions of years ago,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.020
(not dinosaurs)

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.640
Further illustrating that...

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.840
Like...

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.520
The world isn't wizard jizz, just weird and prohibitive,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.520
And really, technology's just nature we taught to do cool tricks.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.280
And to be honest, can you imagine how utterly miserable life was

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.880
Before we got around to using the scientific method?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.600
"What's the meaning of life? And hey, why does my butt hurt?"

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.440
"Just shut up, invent fire, and get the fuck in the hut, Burt."

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.260
Then die prematurely from an easily curable infection.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.340
Got a problem? Tough luck, baby -- natural selection!

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.820
"Complex" is not a synonym for "magic".

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.220
Everything works somehow.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.740
Like a radio. What kind of Harry Potter shit is that?

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.520
Well, first of all, just imagine the universe is made of interactions,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.180
'cause it is,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.060
And one of them is electromagnetism.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.120
And what radio is, is a certain wavelength of that.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.640
And if you vary electric current through a wire, you can create vibrations in the electromagnetic field,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.380
And if you have something that can pick it up on the other end and turn those waves back into sound --

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.260
Well, that's that.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.120
And those are just physical technologies. What about language?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.820
Well, currently there's about 7,000 spoken languages in the world.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.040
Some of them use grammatical gender, some don't,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.100
Some are alphabetic, some are pictographic,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.620
But the one thing they all have in common is that if you learn one,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.340
You can read people's fucking minds.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.740
And this technology took thousands of years to build.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.100
And it's basically the reason we have modern civilization,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.420
And it's... not magic.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.840
Most language processing takes place in the cerebral cortex, we think.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.400
Adult native speakers usually know about twenty thousand to thirty five thousand words,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.460
But there's plenty of people who speak multiple languages,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.720
So closer to sixty thousand words or more.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.840
And did we find language at the top of a mountain?

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.300
Or in a drawer or some shit?

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.360
Oh no, clever dead people gave it to us.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.660
And talking of deaf people,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.920
The difference between our ancestors and us?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.100
Well, mainly reason and rationality.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.380
Look, there's a good story about Descartes.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.140
He was one of the fathers of the scientific method, basically.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.020
And one night he had a bunch of wacky dreams,

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.520
And in one of them an angel came to him, apparently, and said:

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.340
"The conquest of nature is to be achieved through number and measure."

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.000
And that, surely, has to be one of, if not THE most powerful ideas we've ever had:

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.680
Scientific objectivity.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.780
Nature can be understood using mathematics,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.600
Then controlled using technology.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.220
And as long as we remember that the world isn't in our heads,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.820
That the universe has a character,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.420
Well, there may be no limit to what will one day be capable of with technology.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.720
Rationality is absurdly powerful.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.900
It's the reason we're not sitting around in our own excrement.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.440
It's the reason the average high-schooler knows more about the world than the smartest human did

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.740
Not a few hundred years ago.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.980
It's the reason lots of us are living better than every emperor in history.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.220
And Jesus Christ, look what we've done already!

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.620
Antibiotics, or moldy bread in essence,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.800
Has probably saved about 200 million lives since it was discovered.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.600
Your phone has more computing power than all of the computers

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.560
That NASA used to send humans to the moon.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.720
And scientists are now using lasers to listen to black hole collisions

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.360
Billions of years ago via distortions they left behind

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.220
In the very fabric of fucking spacetime itself.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.060
Wizards and witches do exist,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.780
And they cast spells called "research",

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.140
Usually abusing a magic potion called "coffee".

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.520
And if we don't know everything yet, well -- better to have questions you can't answer

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.760
Than answers you can't question, don't you think?

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.820
And furthermore...

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.280
Man, I dunno if we mention this, but, uh...

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.020
The world isn't wizard jizz, maths is where nature lives.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.100
Say, who got us for the moon -- was it witches or physicists?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.820
And if we met aliens -- well hey, that'd be salient,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.540
But they'd still use technology, science and astronomy.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.380
We most likely weren't dreamt up by Zeus in his chariot --

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.060
We started out as slime and a fucking prokaryote.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.400
The world is complex, but when you really look into it,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.960
Even biology isn't magic. Not really.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.840
Abrupt ending so we can lead into the next musical section...

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.380
You know, it's weird.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.520
We used to build stuff mainly to stay alive,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.820
and to make other people stop being alive,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.980
but then we started building stuff to stop from getting bored,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.740
and then we started building stuff to work out how things work.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.240
And that is the kicker.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.220
Because the more you know about how stuff works,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.640
the more you can build even more clever toys.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.820
And we're getting really good at that now.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.760
And my giddy aunt, are strange times ahead.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.440
Cue the synth wave, would you, Timothy?

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.660
I don't know if you were taking notes last century,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.460
but we started it not knowing how to fly, and we ended it with moon landings, and nukes, and the net.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.080
Can you imagine if this century is anywhere near as insane?

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.900
Can you imagine the godlike technologies we'll soon be wielding -- good and bad?

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.360
How about affordable rocket trips?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.980
Or getting everyone in the world online?

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.200
Or a neuro-scientific explanation of consciousness?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.140
Or halfway successful nuclear fusion?

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.100
Or fully, truly immersive VR?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.240
Or the birth of an actual science to combat aging?

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.380
Or the death of disease,

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.980
or convincing AI companions,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.300
or mass scale automation of labor and administration,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.360
or proper spaceships that ride light?

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.010
The universe is a chessboard.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.640
Technology works because we started learning what the moves are that we can make on the board.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.240
And we're getting better and better at that game all the time,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.880
and there's no sign of it slowing down.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.480
And I mean, can you imagine?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.780
Give us another hundred years of scientific research and see where we are.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.420
Give us another thousand -- nay, give us ten thousand,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.080
give us ten thousand more good years of the scientific method,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.300
of careful research, and clever application, and intelligence --

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.240
and mate, we're going to be gods.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.420
We're gonna clothe ourselves in immense power.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.460
We're gonna kick cancer and Alzheimer's, and MS right in the dick.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.900
We're gonna invent new diseases just to cure them for fun.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.700
We're gonna build gargantuan starships.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.420
We're gonna occupy entire galaxies.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.860
We're gonna step outside of history.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.120
We're gonna pilot destiny.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.520
We're gonna burp plasma, we're gonna eat lightning, we're gonna shit algebra.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.760
We're gonna build Dyson spheres on our lunch breaks.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.880
We're gonna fold space and tame chaos.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.980
We're gonna reverse entropy.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.220
We're gonna travel through time.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.000
We're gonna cultivate the perfect wisdom.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.460
We're gonna solve the riddle of being.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.580
We're gonna have entire weeks when no one's unhappy -- anywhere.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.240
We're gonna befriend the fourth dimension.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.220
It is going to be Brock Lesnar shit.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.240
It's gonna be the Rubicon all over again.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.740
It is going to be. Fucking. Biblical.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.280
But even then...

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.080
Even then it still won't be magic or witchcraft --

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.400
Just really, really advanced manipulation of the fundamental physical laws of nature,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.240
made possible by the scientific method,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.440
by the acknowledgement the Nature is bigger than us,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.640
and that Hers is the only game in town.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.300
The scientific method might not be much good for telling us who to marry, or how to live a good life,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.460
but God damn, it's pretty much got everything else on its to-do list.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.100
I mean, how else to put this...

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.360
...like...

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.540
If two people were trying to build a rocket,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.300
and one guy tried to run his on liquid oxygen and the laws of motion,

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.820
and the other filled his with dragon piss and good intentions,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.980
Who do you think would be sipping a cold one on the moon about three days from now?

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.360
THE WORLD ISN'T WIZARD JIZZ
