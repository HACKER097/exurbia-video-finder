00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:07.370
Now, the first thing we'll need is some trombone. *trombone starts playing*

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.460
Yes, that'll do.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.460
Most music is usually either in 3 beats, so strawberry
strawberry or 4 beats, fuck Bill Cosby fuck Bill Cosby

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.279
Now we're going to throw in another instrument
for funsies.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.820
This is an acoustic guitar.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.240
You might recognise it from that dick on
campus who can only play three chords

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.349
and keeps trying to get your girlfriend into bed.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.709
This note only lasts one beat, this is Sally
two beats, this is three beats McGee and Jodie fourster.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.620
There's also half a beat, quarter of a beat, an eighth of a beat, but let's take it slow.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.720
Put notes together and you get a chord.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.500
Usually chords are happy called major or minor
which are the ones that make you want to kill yourself.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.460
But don't, because there's also harmonies *sings* Minge! *stops singing*
which hold up the song, and melodies which

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.510
are the catchy bits that everyone everyone
remembers,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.670
Forte means loud,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.820
Piano means quiet,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.180
Crescendo means get louder,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.540
And Rocco Siffreddi means you're Italian and you probably work in porn.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.760
So we have a bassline and some rhythm.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520
Let's add some cornets.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.540
So, with the likelihood of sex to occur, versus
difficulty to learn an instrument, the cornet

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.000
is somewhere up top,  accompanied close behind by the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.380
bagpipes, tuba, ocarina and nose flute,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.951
On the other hand we have string instruments, electric guitar, and

00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:31.350
Careless whisper played on the saxophone while
wearing nothing but a mankini.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.420
Moving on, orchestras are essentially a big
musical gangbang.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.680
The cornet belongs to the brass family.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.780
There's also the woodwind family who are a bit like the
awkward hufflepuffs, percussion who's basically

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.810
billy no mates, and the strings section, who are the
elite elves of musical middle Earth, oh look

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.430
at us, leading the orchestra, taking all of
the credit.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.180
I hope you all catch something rare and incurable.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.860
Oh I almost forgot, the western scale has
twelve notes but other cultures use more or

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.150
less sometimes,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.340
Sharps and flats are the black notes on a
piano.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.980
If you don’t know what you’re doing you
can just mash them a bit and pretend it’s like jazz (?).

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.400
This is called a break down.Make it a bit sad. Remind people through the power of music that we all die alone.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.840
Add a very long pause for effect. It’s usually best to do this before some
kind of massive climax with drums and stuff.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.700
The longer you leave it the more anticipation
you build.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.320
Like this.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.900
I bet you’re really getting bored now aren’t
you.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.680
Frankly we can call it quits here, really.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.220
You’ve probably had enough of me, and I
know I’ve sure had enough of you.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.950
Anyone doing anything exciting with their weekend?

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.190
Going on any dates?

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.640
No?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.060
Well all right then.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.440
All right, this is the bit where you can really
get creative with the instruments, you've

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.990
got your rhythm, you've got your chords, got
your melody, go nuts, throw in some twiddles.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.700
Lots of people say they wish they'd learned
an instrument when they were young.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.200
Did you know Mozart didn't start playing music
until he was 25?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.860
Now that's a total lie, but if you've got
time to watch youtube videos, you've got time to start learning an instrument. If you want to.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.280
There's a little starter playlist down below
if you're interested for anything you want to learn.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.080
It's never too late.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.100
Unless you're dead.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.390
Then it might be too late.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.940
Finally build to the climax to fortissimo, the
loudest you can go, repeating the same melody,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.060
keeping the original chord sequence, throw in a few sharps and flats for fun

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.400
And...

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.680
*Glass breaks*

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.580
Oppa!
