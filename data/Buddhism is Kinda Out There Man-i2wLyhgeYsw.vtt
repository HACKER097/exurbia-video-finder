00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.680
morning comes and you wake your first

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.200
awareness is of boundless misery you

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.360
long for some kind of caffeinated

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.200
beverage so you can be miserable faster

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.880
you exit your place of dwelling and

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.120
enter the beverage establishment a few

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.000

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.199
i don't mind good choice now beans that

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.200

feet what difference does i don't care i

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.640
don't care well there are at least

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.239
fifteen thousand growers in that region

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.160
i really don't mind would you prefer

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.480
your grower likes or dislikes rappers

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.480
whose names begin with the prefix lil

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.800
what little pump for example

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.399
what i don't give a lil yachty

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.800
little uzi vert

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.800
little chair little table

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.559
little dachshund little harpsichord

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.640
little tokamak nuclear fusion reactor

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.840
well buddhists believe that is the human

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.399
condition

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.920
sort of a perpetual cycle of chasing

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.080
after contentment and ultimately

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.080
receiving only dissatisfaction this

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.920
dissatisfaction is called dukkha and

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.560
this game of rebirthing over and over

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.320
into dissatisfaction happens in samsara

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.720
which is where we live apparently and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.880
the idea is we stay in samsara living

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.640
learning dying being reborn until we

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.400
hopefully attain enlightenment but

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.479
what's enlightenment how is wisdom

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.280
achieved what in the sweet bejesus is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.560
going on with giraffes tongues no but

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.240
look at that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.640
and that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.640
and just

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.520
it's been a weird year well for all of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.400
that we'll need to talk about the big

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.479
man himself

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.799
siddhartha gautama who you will surely

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.799
recognize from his stage name the buddha

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.799
we begin in nepal about two and a half

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.799
thousand years ago siddhartha gautama is

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.640
born into a cushy royal family and

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.399
trying to be nice siddhartha's dad

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.560
shields him from the nasty things in

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.880
life and keeps him in a massive palace

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.719
until at 29 years old on a red jaunt

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.640
outside the palace siddhartha notices

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.439
people who are like way sick and like

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.960
way old and like way dead and realizes

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.440
as my climber friends insist on

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.720
informing me the universe is a pretty

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.720
gnarly place bro so soon after he leaves

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.959
his kingdom and sets off in search of a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040
way to rid the world of suffering it's a

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.640
long story but finally siddhartha sits

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.400
under a tree determining that he will

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.959
not get up again until he has realized

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.400
the true nature of mind the demon mara

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.000
approaches him and tries to lure

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.840
siddhartha away from enlightenment with

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.160
distraction and lust but siddhartha is

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.879
like i'm busy cheers and indeed becomes

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.480
enlightened and attains nirvana nirvana

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.239
literally meaning to blow out to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.000
extinguish we'll get to it in a bit but

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.080
it was then that siddhartha became the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.760
buddha or literally the awakened one

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.959
because he was now free of the three

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.879
great poisons delusion greed and hate so

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.920
one would imagine he was as my climber

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.239
friends like to say pretty stoked bro

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.640
and on your marks get set buddhism a

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.319
world religion is born oh yeah the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.080
slightly tubby smiling guy you might

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.560
have seen little statuettes of yeah

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.800
that's probably not the buddha but budai

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.159
a 10th century monk he's also thought by

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.480
some to be maitreya who's maitreya okay

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.640
this gets wiggly so buddhist philosophy

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.239
is kinda out there man and while

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.840
buddhists don't really have a creation

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.519
myth the universe wasn't spoken or

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.400
sneezed into being they do have some

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.959
fairly trippy ideas about time often in

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.360
buddhism and hinduism cosmic duration is

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.440
divided into eras called kalpas when

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.280
asked how long one type of kalpa was the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.680
buddha allegedly said the length of time

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.640
it would take to reduce a mountain 16 by

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.640
16 by 60 miles to the size of a seed if

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.120
you rubbed it with a silk cloth once a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.040
century so a while now in some

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.879
interpretations siddhartha gautama

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.480
wasn't the first buddha to turn up there

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.560
have apparently been a bunch before and

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.319
will apparently be a bunch after and the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.799
next buddha to turn up in our current

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.200
era in our current calper ages from now

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.760
is supposed to be maitreya represented

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.159
here and possibly represented here also

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.360
by this gentleman and that's who the

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:04.239
little tubby man is so yeah

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.239
yeah yeah

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.729
[Music]

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.160
after about 45 years of teaching the

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.919
buddha died in 483 bce we'll just jump

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.440
ahead a bit because i'm bored and two

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.120
millennia later and buddhism has

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.759
fractured into a bunch of different

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.000
schools one is tibetan buddhism and this

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.919
next cheerful gentleman is of course the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.680
current dalai lama it's tempting to

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.240
think of the dalai lama as the pope of

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.000
buddhism and kinder but the real pope

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.919
isn't the head of christianity just the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.680
catholic church and the dalai lama isn't

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.919
the head of buddhism he's the spiritual

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.160
leader of tibetan buddhism dalai lamas

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.320
aren't elected they're found when a

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.000
dalai lama dies the high lamas leave it

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.520
a while then go looking for the child

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.919
and the deceased dalai lama has

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.680
apparently reincarnated as then once

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.759
confirmed the child is taken off to

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.360
lhasa the capital of tibet to begin the

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.759
process of learning to become the dalai

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.080
lama again the first dalai lama was born

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.000
about 700 years ago and rose from a poor

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.280
child born in a cattle pen to become one

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.120
of the most respected teachers in

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.960
central asia and is rumored to have

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.440
attained buddhahood then did a spot of

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.680
the old dying then came dalai lama ii

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.280
electric buddhalu at the age of four a

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.000
child in the tsang region of tibet

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.000
declares mom dad i am in fact the dalai

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.520
lama and i'd like to see my monks again

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.759
and is confirmed as the first

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.440
reincarnation of the dalai lama he has a

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.919
good run and dies in meditation at the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.000
age of 67. his reincarnation is found

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.800
just a few years later and so on and so

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.560
on up until the sixth dalai lama so this

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.160
is a weird one due to events to

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.080
finickity to go into the sixth

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.800
incarnation was recognized as the dalai

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.320
lama a bit late around the age of 15. a

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.880
few years later though when it got time

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.720
to take his full vows he refused and it

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.280
was not uncommon to see him staggering

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.840
drunk around larsa and visiting brothels

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.919
for some scripture and chill maybe he

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.320
also wrote some romantic and like kind

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.479
of sometimes kinky poetry if i could

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.560
meditate as deeply on the sacred texts

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.800
as i do on you i would clearly be

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.600
enlightened in this lifetime as in

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.400
school is cool but baby for you i got it

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.400
bad as we discussed tibetan buddhism is

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.479
just one branch of many but across all

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.160
the various schools of buddhism mahayana

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.000
theravada and so on there are some

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.919
pillars that are just universally agreed

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.800
upon to begin with there are the four

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.560
noble truths which are one existing is a

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.360
bit crap namely full of dukkha

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.280
dissatisfaction to be is to want to want

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.600
is to eventually be dissatisfied we

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.840
grasp the things monies funnies feline

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.840
tummies sometimes we get them then we

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.479
just keep grasping for more two the

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.639
cause of suffering is craving wanting is

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.400
the problem buddhist claim nothing not

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.319
mansions not games that aren't buggy on

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.479
release can ever be so satisfying they

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.800
kill desire desire is the problem

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.960
because it never ends three the end of

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.039
suffering comes with the end of desire

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.720
the end of grasping the end of craving

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.319
the way out of the forest of suffering

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560
is not to pound down cheeseburgers and

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.720
goldly vodka until every desire is gone

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.840
but to extinguish the flame of desire

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.400
itself to quote a famous line let go or

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.160
be dragged and finally four everything

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.919
will apparently be alright if you follow

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.840
the eightfold path which is basically

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:09.360
crossfit for buddhists and if i can

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.120
think of any theologically appropriate

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.720
jokes maybe we'll get to it but time is

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.720
short and i'm an alcoholic not an

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.560
educator and while we're at it how about

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.039
we do the three marks of existence the

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.880
three constants of being alive the first

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.800
mark of existence is ducker

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.160
dissatisfaction but we've done this one

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.840
already and i hope you're listening

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.039
because there will be a test at the end

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.039
the second is anicha or anika basically

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.199
impermanence reality according to

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:35.039
buddhism is a transient ever-changing

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.680
thing oh you might reply such a

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:39.919
revelation much deep what next fire is

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.080
hot blob fish are gross well actually

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.759
blobfish aren't gross incidentally thank

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.440
you if you keep seeing this image around

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:47.360
that's a blobfish when it's pulled out

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.800
of the water normally blobfish prefer to

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.080
stay at between two thousand and four

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.919
thousand feet in the ocean where they

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.360
look like reasonable fish they look like

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:55.120
that because we yank them out of the

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.560
water and it's one thing that we have

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.160
the audacity to troll them out of the

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.759
ocean in the first place but it's quite

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.960
another to malign their appearance by

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:02.720
pretending that's what they actually

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.319
look like because they don't much like

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.240
if a huge hook came down and pulled one

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:08.000
of us into space and aliens just sat

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.840
around chuckling at our vacuum frozen

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.240
nitrogen swollen corpses going well

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.919
humans aren't very pretty after all

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.840
anyway chaps how about nanty mata

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:20.240
brewski stop it leave blobfish alone

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.319
excuse me reality to our buddhist

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.560
friends is a formless swirling dance of

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:26.479
his from the entropic decaying galaxies

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.960
to the tide eroded rocks of the beach

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:31.280
all is flux all is changed and you will

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.039
die but so will i so it's all right our

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.800
inability to accept a nietzsche to

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.800
accept that everything is impermanent is

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.479
apparently a large source of our dukkha

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.479
of our suffering and because we refuse

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:42.479
to accept change we cling to illusions

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:44.000
of permanence we cling to the stories we

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:45.920
tell ourselves about ourselves and to

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.120
the fleeting forms of the world and on

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.560
that note let me tell you what a

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.399
pleasure it is to live in one's third

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.160
decade of life when you can still enjoy

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:53.839
not just the persistent facial acne you

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.279
thought would go away over a decade ago

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:57.440
but at the very same time begin to

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:59.040
notice gray hairs popping up and say hi

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.959
while you stare at yourself helplessly

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.519
in the bathroom mirror feeling 19 again

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:05.519
and simultaneously 90 nine

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.040
the third mark of existence is called

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.640
anata and it's well you know months ago

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.120
i came down with the cheeky spot of the

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.279
old you-know-what virus i'm fine thanks

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.200
for not asking and trapped indoors for

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:21.200
weeks and almost terminally bored i

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.360
became quite massively addicted to a

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.800
game called town of salem which no one

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.200
is paying me to tell you about i just

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.959
kind of liked it so very briefly you're

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.959
assigned a random role at the beginning

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:33.120
of the game you might be a member of the

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:35.440
town as in the goodies or the baddies

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.760
the witch for example basically the card

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.279
game mafia anyway you don't have to play

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.120
long before you start noticing that

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:42.800
whenever you're assigned as a goodie you

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.800
sort of automatically hate the evil

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.640
players for being so deceptive and then

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.080
again when you're evil you can't stand

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.000
all those life-affirming do-gooder

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.839
morons and you start to have this

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.440
creeping suspicion that quite a lot of

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:56.480
what goes on in our gelatinous meat

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.800
computers is kind of context dependent

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.399
because just as in the game in life

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.279
we're assigned roles we have to play of

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:05.440
course student employee spouse scripted

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:07.519
pretentious know it all online etc and

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.200
like in the game sometimes it's hard to

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:11.279
tell where the roles stop and our

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.120
genuine personalities begin and the

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:14.959
buddhist answer to this is that it's not

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.600
just the world that's impermanent but

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:19.600
ourselves in it our outer identities are

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.519
shifting all the time of course and

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.279
that's just the external stuff on the

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:25.440
inside of our minds it's even more

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:27.600
mental in watching the interior of one's

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.160
own mind it's all sense data and

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.680
thoughts irate happy bored excited

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.399
whatever but in not one of those

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.040
sensations or thoughts will one find an

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:38.640
i a me obviously something is doing the

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.480
experiencing but it doesn't appear to

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.880
have a middle we can grasp or catch

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.640
sight of to bastardize a famous buddhist

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.360
story if someone asked you to show them

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.600
a plane and you did the ailerons and the

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.600
rudder and the engines and they said yes

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.680
yes but where's the plane though you'd

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.680
think that person was a few fries short

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.920
of a happy meal because a plane is just

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.000
the sum of its parts it's a bit like

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.600
that with us our buddhist friends say

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.600
there is no amount of clinging to our

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.680
names to our careers to the constant

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.279
white noise of nonsense thoughts inside

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.079
by which we will catch sight of a

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:11.680
tangible me of an eye and that in a very

00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:14.160
botched way is the third mark of

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.680
existence anata we're clearly conscious

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.079
but our consciousness in buddhism

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.240
doesn't have a center not in time not in

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:22.640
mental space our mental selves are

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.640
constantly in flux ever-changing ever

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.800
impermanent there is a bit of a similar

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.279
sentiment in the science-y cosmological

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.959
tradition that we are star stuff that

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:33.120
underneath the complex recursive

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:35.920
storytelling machinery of our brains i

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.880
am x years old i am x feet high in x

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.040
century i am i beneath those stories

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.600
there is biology and beneath that is

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.920
chemistry and beneath that is a unity of

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.560
physics and deep time that everything is

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.720
made from we were once these then these

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.279
in a while we will be these but we were

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.279
always this and will always be this the

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:57.600
idea is that our identities are

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:59.920
incidental and clinging to them over the

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.160
majesty of the universe is wicked silly

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.639
there is no magical line between baby

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.959
and us now that we can point to and say

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:08.399
and then i became me it isn't so much

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:11.120
that we can't step in the same river

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:13.760
twice but with the entire world in flux

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:17.279
with us in flux it's that we can't even

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.600
step in the same river once

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:22.000
in the dharmapata the sayings of the

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.240
buddha there's the line though one may

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.720
conquer a thousand times a thousand men

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.519
in battle yet he indeed is the noblest

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.320
victor who conquers himself or herself

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:34.880
obviously mastery of the self it's a

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.760
neat idea and boy do we seem a long way

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.880
off from that one just daily life is

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.880
weird enough bound without security lost

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.720
without adventure wandering quietly

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.040
confused for years through the strange

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.200
cityscapes of the 21st century trying to

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.200
find yourself in it in any of it trying

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.519
to find the naive happiness of childhood

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.760
once again and is this what life is now

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:57.760
you think little bursts of euphoria a

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.160
few times a year drug induced or chance

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.240
induced then back to the uniform grey of

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.680
a day you won't remember and if you

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.680
should ever stick your head up above the

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.000
parapet to ask excuse me is this all

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.600
there is then only to be told to shut up

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.440
and just get on with it all the while

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.279
knowing that a star died to make you and

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.040
you no longer find romance in that all

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:16.720
the while being surrounded by miraculous

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.360
technology and you no longer find

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.440
romance in that the absurd ever drama of

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.200
just trying to be okay and the game gets

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.440
faster and the game gets harder more

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.120
gadgets more screens more patches and

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.720
non-stick frying pans and fiber

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.399
broadband and ultrasonic

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.240
toothbrushes and thank you for your

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:34.560
application but and sorry to hear you're

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.040
feeling sad but and we did everything we

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.800
could but please god make me a stone i

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.480
promised myself i'd be more than this i

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.959
promised others i'd be more than this

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.279
alive and not quite living deathly not

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:47.680
quite dead and all the while rages the

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:50.399
inner battle the great quiet attempt to

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.800
fix oneself and knowing no one else can

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:55.120
do it for you and that battle is hardly

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.079
limited to the individual our entire

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.839
civilization is engaged in it too on the

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:03.279
28th of january 1986 an o-ring failure

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:05.920
led to the space shuttle challenger

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:09.279
exploding about 72 seconds into launch

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.760
killing all seven aboard it was horrific

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:13.839
later news anchor tom brackel would say

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.160
of the accident the american public will

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:18.399
be demanding some difficult answers and

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.880
of course we'll all have to examine what

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:23.519
it is that we want from this era of high

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.360
technology those words were said almost

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:28.240
40 years ago now but they couldn't be

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.079
truer still today because it's a fairly

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.000
weird age to live in at the moment

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:34.000
watching the human race attempting to

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.720
protect itself from itself like a

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.800
teenager or mood swings or experimenting

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.519
with new ideologies all smashing up

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.000
mum's car and refusing to apologize in

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:46.160
the last 30 years about a billion people

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.880
have been lifted out of extreme poverty

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.240
which is incredible obviously but as it

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.480
stands in 2021 currently two in three

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.560
humans still live on below ten dollars a

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.800
day and one in ten on less than two

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.399
dollars a day not to mention the 800

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.880
million people who currently don't have

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:05.440
access to safe drinking water plus the

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.680
about 14 000 kids under five who are

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.839
dying preventable deaths every day all

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.320
of which we will all no doubt agree is

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:15.680
and on top of that

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.839
about 800 000 people or one copenhagen

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.680
take their own lives every year and it's

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:22.639
the 10th leading cause of death in the

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.399
u.s alone if there was a day just one

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:26.240
day every century when we all got

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:28.800
together to hash out what our goals

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.720
actually are as a species like top five

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.800
to do's for homo sapiens in the next

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.639
hundred years cheeky trip to nearest

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.800
star system it's on there for sure

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:38.079
making it a un human rights violation to

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.000
start a tinder conversation with a

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:42.079
single smiley face on the list

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.079
definitely but try to make sure

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:46.000
everyone's doing cool and like eating

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:47.920
and stuff no one in their right mind

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
would put that below number one follow

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.160
closely behind by number two when

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.079
everyone's eating and stuff let's all

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.680
work out how to be happy or at least not

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:58.560
living on the edge of existential

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.519
despair yet he indeed is the noblest

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.120
victor who conquers himself or rather if

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:05.279
we make it to the distant future where

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.519
we have warped drives and free energy or

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:09.120
whatever and at the very same time

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:11.440
hundreds of millions of us are still

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.920
living in extreme poverty that isn't

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.839
star trek that's blade runner

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.920
and except for the flying cars and cool

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:19.920
clothes we really don't want blade

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.480
runner the upside of all of this of

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:25.040
course is that it is a choice and human

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.040
problems can be solved by human beings

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.440
in the words of the much missed david

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.519
graber the ultimate hidden truth of the

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.839
world is that it is something that we

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:34.959
make and could just as easily make

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:37.120
differently

00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:41.120
things could be a whole lot worse

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.120
things could be a whole lot better

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:46.399
anyway this has not been an attempt to

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.199
convert anyone to buddhism i'm not a

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:51.440
buddhist i'm barely a person but as an

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:53.360
ideology buddhism has in part probably

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.120
persisted for over two millennia now

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.800
because it points directly to questions

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.680
that are just as relevant today as they

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.440
were two millennia ago namely how can we

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.000
overcome suffering why are we always

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.799
fighting our own stupid nature and what

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.360
actually are we and the answer to a lot

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:11.839
of that buddhism says rather uniquely is

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.760
not up into the big transcendent but

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.760
down into the acceptance of the

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.799
impermanence of the world and into the

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.039
murk of our messy nature that liberation

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:24.400
salvation whatever we call it is waiting

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:26.319
inside the way out is down and as we

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.480
head deeper into potentially the most

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.400
dangerous century in human history this

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.640
battle of trying to regulate our bizarre

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.160
prehistoric tendencies might determine

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.840
whether we come out the other side of

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.320
this century because we're getting

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.200
wicked technological but like are we

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:44.000
much wiser for it you probably know the

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.919
kardashev scale already it's basically a

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.640
litmus test for categorizing how

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:50.720
advanced civilizations could become so a

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.880
type 1 civilization could utilize all

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.039
the energy available on its home planet

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.280
a type 2 civilization all the energy

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:59.600
available in its solar system and a type

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.919
3 civilization all the energy available

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.080
in its galaxy and that's all well and

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:06.240
good but the kardashev scale measures a

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.559
civilization's success by its energy

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.280
consumption though we could use another

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:13.039
metric wisdom a type 1 wisdom

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.880
civilization could have progressed to a

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:16.960
state where no one goes hungry where no

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.280
one needlessly dies of easily curable

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.440
diseases and everyone has at least the

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.000
same starting conditions universally on

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.840
which to try and build a life type 2

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.840
might be a civilization where no one has

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.080
to involuntarily suffer from physical or

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.080
mental maladies from chronic pain from

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.840
anxiety etc maybe where we stop

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.960
inflicting industrial scale harm on our

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.880
animal mates and keeping them in

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.039
horrific conditions but rant over i

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.760
won't go on about it and type 3 a

00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:44.000
civilization where human animal sentient

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.559
toaster whatever doesn't have to suffer

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.559
at all with disease dead with humankind

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:50.320
finally liberated from the evolutionary

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:53.039
genetic shackles that have been tied

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.039
around our legs for millennia and if we

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:57.440
finally arrive at that party at the end

00:18:55.039 --> 00:19:00.000
of time as actual adults at last as

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.080
technological bodhisattvas as masters of

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.080
our own destiny we'll hopefully spend at

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.840
least a little while marveling at just

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.360
how miraculous it was that we managed to

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.200
live through an era in which we could

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.039
land robots on other planets and

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.600
simultaneously still didn't quite know

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:16.000
how to be happy or properly take care of

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.640
all the human family yet and if we make

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.039
it to that party together as a species

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.679
that would be way cool yo i'm hella

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:24.880
stoked for that yo i trust you are too

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:27.120
yo

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.080
but until then

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.600
well

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.400
until then

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.919
so

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.160
until then

00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:36.000
and until then

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.440
and until

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.360
[Music]

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.360
until then
