00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
1) Floss. It is essential for good dental
hygiene. 2) Take a long walk now and then

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.880
3) Eat several servings of fruit a day.
4) Don't drink caffeine before bed.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.700
5) Attempt to sleep at least seven hours a
night and 6) Accept that he / she is never

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.170
coming back. 7) Accept that the past is
irreparable and dwelling on it will

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.840
change nothing.
8) Dwell on it anyway, and then move on.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.180
10) Travel alone, if you can. Avoid the
tourist traps, learn one to ten and

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.700
please and thank you in the local
language, and you've already surpassed

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.050
90% of all the tourists who have ever
been there before you. 11) Acquire new

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.620
talents for the sake of acquiring them.
If you're young, learn an instrument if

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.760
possible you will never have this much
free time ever again. 12) Exercise at least

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.460
three times a week-
vigorously. 13) Buy clothes that fits

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.120
properly you'll notice the difference in
your dating life. 14) Always check your

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.020
system has the specs to run the game. ~fukh~
15) Always check the milk is in date ~fukh~

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.329
16) Always check the lid hasn't fallen down ~fukhhh~
17) Accept there will be whole weeks

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.050
when you understand nothing and
everything hurts except sometimes stupid

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.780
people get lucky, and sometimes smart people never make it.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.470
18) Accept that girl in class likely isn't
going to strike up a conversation first,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.310
but if you do it will probably go
alright.  20) Accept that just because it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.140
weird,
doesn't mean it's clever. 21) Accept that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.890
George Lucas does deserve respects
regardless of the prequels. 22) Accept it's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.880
okay if you can't use chopsticks and
23) Accept that there is a set point in the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.630
future, after your death when you'll be
thought about for the final time by a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.369
friend or family member and then
forgotten from history forever... (unless you become a meme ofc)

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.180
24) Spend more time with your parents if
they're alive. Even if they are nob-ends,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.240
there will come a time when they will be
gone, and there will be no one to phone

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.170
home to, no more hugs, no more bickering,
no more in-jokes from your childhood.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.380
25) Argue about politics if you must, but
accept that the other person won't

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.470
change their view if you start being a
dick besides even from a tactical

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.520
perspective being nice is always more
likely to persuade someone anyway.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.090
26) Follow cutting-edge physics if you have the
time. It is the process of humans

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.200
learning to speak fluent universe.  27) Accept
that expensive whiskey is almost always

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.799
worth the money. 28) Accept that expensive
running shoes that almost never worth

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.730
the money. 29) Accept that youtubers and
online personalities are often people

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.750
who couldn't get into the field they wanted to.
Do not take their word as gospel.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.069
Especially pretentious advice from
disembodied smart-ass narrators, whose

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:28.030
life is probably considerably duller
than yours...mhm... 30) Attempt to tolerate meta

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.470
humor? 31) Accept that no one is in charge,
not properly and no one has a handle on

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.090
any of this; Not even Stephen Fry. 32)Avoid the new season of Twin Peaks if you wish

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.840
to conserve your sanity, watch it if not.
33) Come to terms with the fact that there

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.739
is probably no absolute truth that you'll
grasp in your lifetime. However, if

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.250
someone at the party tries to tell you
everything is relative, invite them to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.720
exit the building from the 5th floor and
see if gravity is also a social fucking

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.590
construct. 34) Do not be intimidated by
people who use long words- they are

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.079
likely more insecure about their own
intelligence than you are.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.530
Instead afford them your most
"effervescently magnanimous approbation"

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.130
35) Before tidying up,
make the bed, suddenly everything will

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.290
seem easier. 36) Visit the dentist at regular
intervals. 37) Read Ray Bradbury. Always.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.440
38) Do not purchase cheap Cellotape. It is about
time someone stuck it to those

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.000
bastards. 39) Embrace your own eccentricity(weirdness)
What made you a freak as a kid, will

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.180
likely make you an interesting adult.
40) Learn the names and positions of at

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.370
least four constellations. I recommend
Orion, Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, and Cassiopeia.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.660
This is guaranteed to be useful in a
romantic setting at some point.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.680
41)Try to eat less salt. 42) Try to eat more vegetables,
43) Try to accept that happiness isn't a

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.970
constant state, nor does it come for free.
It is a chemical reward for hard work

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.840
and to get more of it one has to do more..
hard work. This applies to careers,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.120
relationships, friendships, and especially
Factorio™

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.750
44) Diet if you want to, but acknowledge that all
diets- however elaborate- are all

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.519
variations on eat less, move more. 45) Keep a
journal if you have time, it'll serve as

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.519
a snapshot for how silly your life
decisions are right now, and you can read

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.879
it in ten years and chuckle and write some
more and then you can read that in

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.049
another 10 years and have another
chuckle. ~great fun!~ 46) If you're of legal age,

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.599
VOTE for Christ's sake™ 47) Attempt to locate
your passions. When you locate them, see

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.290
if they can be monetized. If they can,
congratulations you've just discovered

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.769
your career. Prepare for crippling
failure. It is the ultimate character

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.010
building, and almost no one successful
has ever avoided it happening to them

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.210
multiple times. 49) If something terrible
befalls you, and you think nothing this

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.280
bad has ever happened to anyone ever
before, remember it has, worse, repeatedly

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.789
and to almost everyone. They got through
it. Some of them are probably going

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.070
through it right now,
they just haven't told you. You will

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.120
almost certainly, be fine. 50) Stay away from
synthetic weed. 51) Resist the appeal of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.650
depressing nihilism- if everything is
pointless, you may as well just be in a

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.220
good mood anyway. :')
52) Grow some kind of novelty facial hair if

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.700
necessary, but don't get all uppity when
no one takes you seriously. In the words

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.040
of John Waters- 53) "If you go home with
somebody and they don't have books...

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.420
...don't fuck 'em" ™. 54) Spend good money on mattresses.
55) Don't put sugar in someone else's tea

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.460
unless specifically requested to. 56) Do not
dig down.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.840
57) Ignore all of the previous instructions...

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.440
..Except this. 58) And most
important and vital to happy living

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.800
without parallel- floss™ it is essential
for good dental hygiene

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:28.280
