00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
This is the 5th Duke of Portland,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.260
and he was a bit of a whack job.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.860
In the 1800s he lived here, in Welbeck Abbey.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.900
He was so introverted, he had his meals delivered to his room by a miniature train.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.240
Employing 15000 workers, the duke constructed, under the house,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.060
a 250 foot long library,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.400
15 miles of tunnelling,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.320
and the largest ballroom in England, capable of accommodating 2000 guests –

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.280
a touch ironic, considering the man would hide behind an umbrella if anyone approached him.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.220
(Probably put water in his cereal as well...)

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.420
My birth country has a long-standing habit of excusing borderline insanity as some kind of charming eccentricity,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.000
but it isn't just my country –

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.540
history is full of wonderful and great oddballs,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.240
many of whom we have forgotten.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.700
And none of them are you, because

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.220
 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.940
Sorry... about that.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.220
1805, and the poet Lord Byron, or just Byron then,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.260
has enrolled in Trinity College Cambridge.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.980
He finds out dogs are banned.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.220
"Alright", Byron says,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.320
"What about bears, though?"

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.460
"Ehhnnnzzzzggeeee",

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.000
Trinity College Cambridge says.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.220
Byron gets a bear,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.100
and it stays in his lodgings, and he takes it for walks on a chain, much like a dog.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.680
So, that... happened.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.220
Several years later, John Mytton was on an alleged ration of eight bottles of port a day.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.660
One day, he invites a number of his well-meaning neighbors over to his house.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.040
John Mytton then bursts into the drawing room...

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.400
riding a bear.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.360
The animal was not a sporting fellow, as it turned out, as it bit Mytten, then went on to attack a servant.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.100
"Ursus"?

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.360
More like "Arsus"...

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.220
Anyway, that's just rich people, though, isn't it?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.440
Anyone could go bonkers if they have lots of cash.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.980
Well, how about rags to riches stories?

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.400
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.300
Early 1800s, and Ching Shih

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.780
 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.140
is a Chinese prostitute.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.220
Somehow, she meets swashbuckling motherfuckling pirate Zheng Yi,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.580
and they decide to get married.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.160
They grow Zheng Yi's pirate fleet from 200 to 1800 ships, or about 70000 men and women.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.320
When Zheng Yi died in 1807, his widow took over the fleet,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.380
and Ching Shih became Empress of one of the largest navies in the world,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.260
and a PIRATE navy at that.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.720
Now, admittedly, one answer you may not expect to the question "what do pirates need more of" is

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.320
"accountants", but they did.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.400
Ching Shih introduced taxes and laws to her pirate utopia.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.360
Loot had to be registered before it was distributed among the fleet,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.260
and if you disobeyed Ching Shih, you were free to hang up your pirate hat and go your separate way –

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.500
just as long as you left your fucking head behind.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.160
She wandered about from Canton to Macau, beating the shit out of the Chinese, British, Portuguese –

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.300
Yarrrr, etc. –

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.420
until finally the government offered her and her pirates amnesty,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.820
which is a bit like if you stole everyone's kettles, and they responded by inviting you over for a cup of tea.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.720
Her power was slipping away anyway, so eventually she accepted, the fleet disbanded,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.560
quite a few of her pirates got cushy jobs,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.860
and Ching Shih took a piratical sabbatical, kept her fortune,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.620
and was given a noble title, effectively becoming a member of the aristocracy,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.540
set up a gambling house, and lived a relatively nice life.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.380
What is the moral of the story here?

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.000
Be clever,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.800
Be clever,
be a pirate,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800
Be clever,
be a pirate,
kill people,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.720
Be clever,
be a pirate,
kill people,
...chill?..

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.740
Pretty badass, anyway.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.820
Then again, there are plenty of great humans who weren't necessarily unusual or eccentric –

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.180
they were just doing the right thing, or trying to –

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.020
again, unlike...

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.540
 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.400
In 1983, Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov is monitoring the Soviet nuclear early warning system,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.180
and notices that five nuclear missiles are apparently inbound from the US.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.040
Petrov has a choice: he either picks up the phone and reports this to his superiors, and initiates probably a Russian response,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.480
meaning nuclear war on potentially millions of casualties, or...

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.080
he... doesn't.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.280
He has a bit of a think: five missiles does seem a bit unlikely, considering the US at the time has thousands to play with.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.480
As you may have guessed from the fact that we are still here,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.540
Petrov did not report the strike, and decided the warning was a glitch –

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.120
which, indeed, it was, thanks to sunlight reflecting off of the clouds.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.580
So, большое спасибо for that...

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.640
Or, this is Ignaz Semmelweis, who was to medicine

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.840
what the chief iceberg inspector must have been to the RMS Titanic.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.680
Semmelweis was a doctor in the 1800s, and he noticed that –

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.380
now, I hope you're sitting down for this –

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.040
washing your hands before delivering a baby actually stops women dying,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.660
particularly from what was then called "childbed fever".

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.860
Humans wouldn't discover germ theory for a while yet, but it didn't matter –

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.180
Semmelweis knew that something changed when doctors kept their hands clean,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.340
so he informed the medical community of this,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.760
and won loads of awards, and died happy and respected, and-

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.360
 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.300
Semmelweis was ridiculed mercilessly by the medical community, despite having proof of his hygiene theory,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.980
eventually had a breakdown, and died 14 days after being committed to a mental institution,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.400
probably after being beaten up by the guards.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.780
Stellar...

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.600
A century later, and this is Sergei Korolev.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.320
In 1933, he designed the first liquid-fuel rocket to take off in the USSR.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.300
He was rewarded for his efforts with imprisonment and a stay in the Gulag.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.960
By some miracle he was released, and went on to mastermind the first satellites in space,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.000
the first dog,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.560
and, of course, the flight of Yuri Gagarin,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.980
who on the 12th of April 1961 became the first of the Homo sapiens to leave the Earth,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.100
orbiting our planet for 108 minutes in "Vostok 1".

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.480
Sergei Korolev would die five years later,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.380
probably thanks to injuries sustained in the Gulag.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.280
The Soviet space program was extremely secretive, and he was largely unknown in his lifetime.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.460
As history marches on, one day our period will blur into the countless others – behind and ahead.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.660
We are not special, but some events will stand out.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.220
This will stand out.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.780
It was the first time we ever touched the heavens,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.920
and it was in large part brought to us by a man grossly mistreated in his lifetime,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.360
and largely still untalked of today, outside of science and engineering circles.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.000
There is currently a portrait of him in the service module of the International Space Station above us right now.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.520
And if, by some miracle, our species emerges from its current adolescence,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.880
there is every chance Sergei Korolev's portrait will one day accompany astronauts

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.960
to corners of the heavens Korolev couldn't have imagined

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.980
even in his wildest dreams.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.660
So, in light of all this, what makes a great person of history?

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.040
Well, let's start with two "born to ideal parents" eggs –

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.360
yes, lovely;

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.120
two cups of "in the right place at the right time" sugar –

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.940
excellent;

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.940
three cups of natural talent flour; and, finally,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.180
two and a half teaspoons of greatness.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.100
Now, where is the greatness?..

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.040
No...

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.120
No, no... tsk... Oh!

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.240
Oh, that's right, we we don't have any in at the moment,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.760
because it doesn't fucking exist!

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.640
For the longest time I believed that there were two types of people:

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.620
the knowers, who knew what they were doing with their lives,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.400
and then the feckless plebs like me, who were just wandering idiots going from plan to misguided plan.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.000
Thirty is now spitting distance away from me, and, you know, the most traumatic part of exiting one's twenties

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.280
isn't the sudden random failure of body parts, nor the blissful crushing hug of student debt,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.520
or even losing the ability to party past six in the morning and not die –

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.560
it is the realization that this model is bollocks, because these people do not exist.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.620
Now, clearly, expertise exists –

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.180
don't trust a barista to fly your plane, nor a pilot to make your double frothy laxative anxiety juice –

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.100
but when it comes to wisdom, or working out how to be happy, or big boy and big girl meaning of life stuff,

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.900
no one has a damn clue what they're doing – not your heroes, not the smartest among us.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.540
When it comes to matters of the soul, it is open season.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.840
And this is a wonderful thing, because it means that as far as art or innovation goes, the world is anarchy,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.960
and while you may have convinced yourself that there's no point trying to do anything groundbreaking or novel because someone will do it better –

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.560
whoever the greats are that you respect, obviously they had the same doubts, and they pushed through it.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.340
They were intensely interested in or devoted to something,

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.700
while simultaneously feeling lost all the time.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.640
A long period of confusion isn't a side effect of trying to do something radically interesting –

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.100
it's the price of admission.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.500
We forget that Van Gogh was 27 before he even bothered trying to paint properly,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.920
that Darwin told us: "I was considered by all my masters and my father a very ordinary boy,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.900
rather below the common standard of intellect",

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.840
that Emily Dickinson was barely even recognized during her lifetime,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.480
that it wasn't until a hundred years after Melville's death that anyone really gave a damn about Moby-Dick.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.740
They were beset on all sides by mean critics, or the worst critic of all – themselves.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.520
Cthulhu's dick, I have heard of art classes where the teacher begins the first semester

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.440
by assuring the students they'll never break through, and it's pointless to try;

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.880
rejection letters writers received, instructing them to put down their pens and never bother at it again;

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.260
vacuous jaded bollocks that convinces young artists to give up –

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.740
but may I humbly recommend that if one is informed you will never do anything remarkable with your life,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.600
perhaps the most appropriate response isn't

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.920
"Yeah, you're probably right",

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.780
but rather,

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.360
"Fuck off! And who the fuck are you anyway?!"

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.780
The shit they will tell you –

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.080
"you've had all your good ideas",

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.120
"it's all been done before",

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.820
"you're too old, too young, too dumb",

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.960
"there's nothing new under the sun" –

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.680
let's say your lifespan is 80 years, or about 29,200 days.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.460
If you're 18, you're about 6,500 days through.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.500
28 – about 10,000 days through.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.680
38 – about 14,000 days through.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.600
Regardless of whether one believes in an afterlife or not, these days are not coming back,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.140
and there is not enough time to listen to cynics.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.269
By the power of Grayskull, look at where we are –

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:06.560
historically, technologically, galactically – the whole game!

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.040
This isn't normal, is it?

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.060
Act without expectation.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.200
Make cool stuff just because.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.740
Give cats fishies always.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.240
Oh, for fu-
Have you been editing the script again?

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.740
Today, this week, this month, year, decade, and century –

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.320
it will occasionally be referenced in history, and that will be that.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.720
If one is cautious about pursuing an unusual path,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.280
it may help to remember that the cynics will be forgotten just as readily as your failures will be, too.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.380
There has never been a better time to do a thing.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.160
And just by virtue of how weird existing is in the first place,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.880
there are a trillion interesting things still undone, unmade, and unsaid.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.080
Those areas have not been drilled, Eli.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.960
It is a wilderness out there for everyone. It always was.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.500
The greats didn't know they were greats – they were just mortal humans who refused to bow to cynicism.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.360
And were we to draw some collective lesson from their lives, it might sound something like:

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.580
 

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.620
in your projects,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.960
in your silly pursuits,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.440
in your unlikely follies,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.420
and your expeditions into the abyss

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.560
to recover those strange mental metals

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.220
you will fashion into something no one has ever made before.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.080
I wish you the very, very best of luck.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.480
Now so0d off and be remarkable please.
