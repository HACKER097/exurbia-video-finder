00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.760
In just under a week there's going to be a referendum on whether the UK stays in or leaves Europe.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.060
Luckily the issue is pretty simple on both sides.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.280
Oh wait. It isn't.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.480
It's insanely complicated and it's probably the most important decisionthat's been made in a generation of British life.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.560
It's called the British exit - or Brexit, which sounds sort of like a quirky organic cereal.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.300
So here's a cheeky little overview of what's been going on recently in "tea-ville".

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.480
To get elected last year,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.540
the British prime Minister David Cameron had to promise that he would let the British people decide if we stay in the EU or not.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.500
Unfortunately for him, he now has to make good on that promise.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.260
And here we are.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.740
Depending on which way the vote goes, we either keep strumming our Uk-EU-leles

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.180
or use the Emergency Brexit and go our own way.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.760
The problem is that the Brexit is an absolute gang bang of special interests.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.200
Politicians are politicians and are getting donations from people with a vested interest in leaving or staying;

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200
Business is business and wants to make money;

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.140
And then there's us - the plebs - trying to make sense of this stuff and vote sensibly.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.140
There are millions of arguments about what to do,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.760
so we're going to stick to the five most common ones on each side and go from there.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.160
There are two camps: the Euroskeptics and the Euro supporters.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.680
First then the Euroskeptics.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.680
Here are some reasons why the Euroskeptics want to leave the EU.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.160
1. Free movement

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
If you're a member of a country in the European union,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.120
you can work wherever you like and move around freely without a visa.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.060
Euroskeptics are pretty annoyed about this and often argue that the UK is being flooded with immigrants

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.620
who are using welfare without justification or flooding the economy with cheap labour.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.420
They argue that there are countries like Australia and Canada who already have tight border control.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.040
So why can't the UK do the same?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.840
2. EU regulations.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.520
Euroskeptics were also pretty worried about the EU parliament.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.880
The EU parliament can now create laws that have to be obeyed in the UK

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.640
without going through the UK Parliament.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.160
There are also a bunch of officials in the European parliament who aren't actually elected.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.460
Lots of people are worried this is the beginning of the end for UK sovereignty.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.740
3. Integration

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.520
Lots of the EU already use the Euro

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.200
and it's obviously moving towards becoming a kind of super country in its own right.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.380
Euroskeptics obviously don't want that to happen.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.320
Europe is also talking about getting its own army, which some Brits are quite alarmed about.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.120
4. Economic independence

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.580
Lots of people argue that the UK can stand on its own two feet and doesn't need to trade inside the EU.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.980
The commonwealth is still a thing and some economists argue that this could easily sustain us as well as other markets.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.160
So why bother being part of the EU?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
5. Euro Euro bills, y'all!

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.600
The EU pays somewhere around 12 billion a year to remain a member of the EU

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.040
which lots of people think is a bit steep considering we don't even get a loyalty card or a free hat.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.600
If we pull out we also won't have to abide by European economic regulations,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.540
we'll be a completely separate economy from the EU

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.140
and there is an argument that we might prosper as a result of that.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.440
In other words: Brits or GTFO.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.940
For those reasons - and lots of others -

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.080
some brits think pulling out will hopefully restore former glory, tighter borders and greater Sovereignty to our Island nation.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.600
However, as some of us may know too well already, pulling out isn't always a reliable method.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.240
And that's where the other side comes in: the Pro-European argument.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.500
Here are some arguments from Brits who want to stay in the EU:

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.860
1. Employment.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.620
Around 3.5 million jobs might depend on being in the EU.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.340
And if we leave, lots of manufacturers might just go abroad.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.480
Also around 10% of the UK's gross National value comes from the financial Sector,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.100
despite the fact that is full of complete and utter bankers.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.780
2. Research and funding

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.480
Plenty of top scientists in Britain come from elsewhere in Europe.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.140
This might change in a big way if we leave.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.640
Also the UK receives a fair bit of money from the EU for research funding and this could vanish and impact Academia.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.980
3. Security

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.280
Yes, once we had an Empire, but these days we just sit around watching reruns of Fawlty Towers,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.240
reminiscing about the good old days of "Oh, terribly sorry to bother you, is this your country?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.480
Oh, good. Could we have it, please? No?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.480
Yoink!

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.480
Global politics is changing. Certain leaders of very powerful nations...

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.020
...are getting a bit bossy.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.900
And there're also nuclear rogue states with itchy trigger fingers.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.260
Some Brits argue pulling out is silly when we could be militarily stronger

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.480
for sticking it out with Germany and France and the rest of the EU.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.920
4. Emigration, but from the other side.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.740
For those Brits who live in other EU countries, they may have to go home

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.220
or at least get married pretty quickly if we leave the EU.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.720
Also, if the economy goes tits up again, it means as a British citizen

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.340
you won't just be able to swan off to some other country in the EU and start over.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.560
5. Multinational corporations

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.180
Every year these corporations do something horrific and the EU generally steps in and finds their asses.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.000
If the UK switches to single player mode, then there's the possibility it could be pushed around a lot more by the likes of certain big financial players.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.420
Anyway, that's about 0.5% of all the arguments out there, but you get the idea.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.700
Right now British television is a montage of people screaming at each other

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.100
and it's almost impossible to take a definitive position.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.720
The Euroskeptics argue that this might be the only chance we have to leave Europe and we need to seize it now.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.160
The Pro-Europeans argue that leaving Europe could be a death blow to the economy

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.620
and to Britain in general that we never truly recover from.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.800
And either position might be correct.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.800
No one knows what's going to happen next but whatever it is is going to be pretty Bloody historic.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.600
So happy voting and no pressure!

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.080
It's only the future of our entire country and our great-great grandchildren that we're deciding.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.820
Cheerio!
