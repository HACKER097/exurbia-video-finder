00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.520
dear nia you died

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.720
seven months ago in the blaze of a drone

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.720
bomb when it fell

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.080
unceremoniously into our living room

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.400
where you sat working

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.320
there was a funeral it was fancy the

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.800
great death of a great scientist

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.160
and then they gave me the urn and i

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.320
didn't know what to do

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.920
just left it on top of the bookshelf and

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.439
whisked your ashes good morning and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.359
wished your ashes goodnight

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.880
kidding myself that if i didn't scatter

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.800
them then none of this

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.000
would have happened i threw out some of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.320
your clothes and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600
slept next to the rest your smell is

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.520
fading from them already

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.280
and i think soon enough i won't remember

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.520
what you smelled like at all

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.800
i perform the standard rituals i feed

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.879
the cats i drink

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.399
liberally i watch the higgs fall out on

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.559
the horizon at night

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.239
the war goes on i've surrendered already

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.360
sauron dear sauron

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.680
it was strange and good and strange

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.559
to get your message though on this side

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.719
it was you

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.600
who died seven months ago in the fire of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.440
that drone bomb

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.960
as it came streaking into not the living

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.520
room but the kitchen

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.240
at my request you weren't cremated but

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.000
buried

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.680
you can imagine what a thing it was

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.360
today to visit your grave

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.080
then come home to find your message

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.080
waiting for me but i'm glad you wrote

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.600
we are living in those strange first

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.439
years of a new technology

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.799
when language can't capture what it is

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.880
yet i told a friend

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.000
about your message she called it a

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.640
seance but

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.119
a seance is for the dead and you're not

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.000
dead

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.479
and you are dead and you're not dead

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.560
it's

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.320
horrible to think all it took that bomb

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.119
to wander into the kitchen rather than

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.520
the living room

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.720
with some tiny perturbation in the air

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.960
above our house

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.200
the war is distant on this side i

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.920
haven't seen the higgs clouds in weeks

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.399
and i am not in an urn thank you for

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.399
your message

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.720
dear nia i am trying not to cry at my

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.200
keyboard

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.799
i wasn't even sure you'd reply your lab

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560
friends have told me that the bridge

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.119
between us should stay open for a few

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.439
weeks

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.360
but they can't guarantee anything when i

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.119
got permission to use the equipment they

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.280
warned me not to get my hopes up

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.640
that even if i found you you probably

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.200
wouldn't be from a world line

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.080
i recognized you wouldn't be ania i

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.720
recognized

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.680
but i do recognize you your words sound

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.760
like mineir

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.760
i hope that's who you are whatever this

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.879
strange magic you've invented is it's

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.720
your legacy now

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.879
on this side they talk about you like

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.800
you're some great martyr of science

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.560
but now i know you're the best kind of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.120
martyr a living one

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.879
you are missed the dog doesn't sleep on

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.560
our bed anymore but waits for you

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.080
at the door you still get posts

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.239
sometimes too i'll

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.280
scan and attach it with this message

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.560
it's just very

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.280
very good to hear from you soren dear

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.959
soren

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.599
i think maybe you're not clear how this

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.080
works you told me the war is still going

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.120
strong

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.800
on your side it's almost over for us i

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.200
don't want to make you sad but that

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.879
means

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.800
our world lines are getting distant

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.680
already i know you could never stand

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.239
jargon but

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.519
look the equipment uses a single

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.760
particle suspended

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.120
in superposition just at the moment of

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.440
wave function collapse

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.400
it lives half in your world line half in

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.640
mind it is

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.599
a fragile bridge between two splitting

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.080
universes

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.000
that's how we're talking every time a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.360
particle's wave function collapses

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.519
it births new world lines new universes

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.440
splitting off like coral and then more

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.000
particles deviate inside those world

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.680
lines

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.200
more coral branching out every

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.080
measurement of the world fracturing the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.640
world again

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.159
and again new universes born over and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.159
over side by side

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.440
this isn't just about your world line

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.760
and mine there are

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.879
quadrillions of them next door there is

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.720
a world line where

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.480
yes i stayed for a few more hours at

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.239
work that night and the bomb never fell

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.680
on me and we're both still alive

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.440
there's a world line where the bomb got

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.319
both of us there's a world line where we

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.640
never met

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.360
but how much does your wildline and mind

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.519
differ

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.439
maybe you're near like scrambled eggs or

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.239
tolerate jazz or hated autumn or

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.720
whatever

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.599
we'll never know but we are not from the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.439
same world

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.640
i don't mean to be cold but please

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.720
understand this gift

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.000
for what it is it's not the beginning of

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.799
a correspondence

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.080
it's a chance to say goodbye my husband

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.319
is in that graveyard

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.760
your wife is in that urn please don't

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.479
send me her post again

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.680
i am not your nier the army retook

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.320
hypatia today

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.520
the war's almost over for us thank you

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.720
for your message

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.240
nia dear nia well

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.320
in this world line you didn't like

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.160
scrambled eggs or jazz so how's that for

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.639
more evidence you are who i think you

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.320
are

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.960
yes things are a little different on

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.360
this side yes hypatia is gone for me

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.600
already it got higgs to dust a few weeks

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.759
ago but that's world history not

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.680
us i'm sitting in our garden writing

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.240
this our garden staring at

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.280
our roses and a world line away maybe

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.360
you're sitting here too

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.479
at this very moment right next to me

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.479
when you built this thing

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.080
this technique whatever the hell it is

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.000
what did you want to use it for

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.919
what could be a better application than

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.160
this a second chance

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.199
we're just a universe distant don't

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.680
throw this away

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.160
please it was until death do us part and

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.440
you are alive and i am alive and don't

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.479
throw this away

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.440
yours devotedly soarin

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.160
dear soren there aren't any roses in our

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.400
garden

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.880
not here you're still not getting it are

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.639
you even if the only difference between

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.720
your wildline and mine was a gust of

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.199
wind above our house seven months ago

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.840
that difference has changed everything

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.080
we have

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.960
many bridges to many other world lines

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.720
on this side

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.960
we've heard from some that never had the

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.960
war and many more that have been hixed

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.360
to oblivion with our village gone

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.280
with the cities gone i've spoken with

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.840
them with some of the survivors

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.759
i've offered my condolences and then

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.000
i've turned off the magnetic field

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.039
and let the wave function collapse so i

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.199
can never talk to them

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.280
again because i have nothing to say that

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.440
would help them because they are not

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.280
us i am not from that world line where

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.840
the sky is burst open with the higgs

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.759
fallout

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.080
i am not from the world line where you

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.800
lost me you asked why i built the

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.639
equipment

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.000
officially as a screw you to the

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.560
copenhagen theorists

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.080
unofficially because i knew there must

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.000
be at least one world line

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.479
where a single cell hadn't begun the

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.280
process of dividing madly out of control

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.759
inside mara's body and we'd never lost

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.240
her

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.440
to cancer i found one of those world

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.240
lines eventually

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.440
she is 11 now she has your stupid

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.240
sentimental streak

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.880
she has my pragmatism i spoke to her for

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.880
an evening

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.000
just like you and i are doing now i told

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.199
her i missed her

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.600
and what did she say she said okay

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.120
because what can she say in her world

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.000
line she still has parents

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.639
still has her life she said okay because

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.880
i am not

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.080
her mother i am not her mother in the

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.960
same way as i am not

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.319
your wife i let her go and you need to

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.720
let me go now

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.759
i believe one day when this technology

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.240
reaches fruition

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.840
that humans will develop a new sense an

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.000
evolutionary adaptation

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.000
for seeing ourselves as one among

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.400
billions of branching versions of our

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.599
possible selves for intuiting that we're

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.759
not individuals

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:09.280
but simultaneous travelers across the

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:12.080
atlas of if

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.000
you and i don't have that adaptation and

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.800
so we're still seeing the world lines

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.599
as periscopes into parallel worlds but

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.240
they're not

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:21.520
their mirrors cracked distorted

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.440
fairground mirrors

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.880
you are the 586th soren to contact me

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.520
and you are the 586th soren who i will

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.639
inform

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.639
first that i miss him and second

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:37.039
that i am severing the bridge now

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.039
because i am severing the bridge now

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:40.160
i can't stop you contacting the other

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:42.479
widowed niers

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.080
maybe there's a softer kind of me out

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:45.520
there who will keep this game up with

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.240
you who will send letters

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.840
to a ghost i wish you luck finding her i

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.639
wish you luck with the war

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.639
i wish you luck moving on take comfort

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.280
in knowing that beside our grey

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:59.120
half-lives a world line away who knows

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.080
what became of a single subatomic

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.400
deviation

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.440
great palaces in the sky continents

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.240
without starvation

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.120
or deprivation and somewhere across the

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.919
coral

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.840
you and i are still swimming together

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:13.850
yours

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.520
probabilistically near

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.800
[Music]

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.400
dear near that's very poetic but i think

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.400
you're just hurting like i am

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.000
grieving is horrible i know it but

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.720
please don't do anything rash with the

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.879
connection

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.039
i'll be sitting by my inbox all day just

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:31.280
right back as soon as you dear nia

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:32.959
it's been a week of nothing from you now

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.839
i know you're upset i'm sure it must all

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:35.760
be strange but

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:37.360
things are getting horrible here and i

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.959
wish you'd write you were always

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.000
stubborn but i could always win you

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:41.760
around and i hope

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.839
it's one of those times dear near

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.200
they've started higgsing everything now

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:46.560
and i don't think it's long before the

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.240
radiation reaches us

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.920
please just tell me how you are please

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.480
tell me you're okay please tell me

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.480
something

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.000
for the sake of even an iota of decency

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.839
will you please just write back

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.519
hell you built all of this you can't

00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:59.760
just take nia a month

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:01.760
a month of nothing you're right maybe

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.160
there are differences in the world lines

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.680
my nia was never this stubborn or myopic

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.040
would never have trodden heartlessly on

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.560
the hearts of those around her

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.399
are you going to leave me trapped here

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.519
trapped with this urn and the blue hell

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.040
dust on the horizon

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:14.720
and the bodies in the streets and the

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.640
noise and the hangover mornings

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.800
and the stumbling nights my god it meant

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.959
nothing did it not a damn thing not you

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.160
and i no civility not peace agreements

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:23.920
not civilization

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.080
all of it just some stupid veneer to

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.180
cover up how dumb we still all are

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.440
fine leave me here

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:34.320
[Music]

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.000
dear madam it is with great pleasure

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.560
that we award you the title of

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.240
a doctor of philosophy specifically in

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.320
the field of the foundations

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.519
of quantum mechanics i would like to

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.440
personally apologize

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:47.839
for our delaying of awarding your

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.560
doctorate but as i'm sure you understand

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:52.640
your research was somewhat unorthodox

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.279
particularly the correspondences you

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.120
submitted

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:56.720
between your counterpart and the

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.360
counterpart of your husband

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.000
from the so-called parallel world lines

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.240
i have

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.480
since used your technique to speak to my

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.720
counterparts from several world lines

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.600
and can report the experience is a

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.360
strange one

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.720
though will no doubt become a common

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.360
practice for us all

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.000
soon enough i can also recommend several

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.519
therapists

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.440
i have subsequently required the

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:18.800
services of now that these

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.040
so-called world lines have been

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.360
confirmed i would also like to seek your

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.680
approval of my forwarding your thesis

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.040
to the ministry of defence in light of

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.360
the global conflict

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.160
our world line has apparently narrowly

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.640
avoided

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.279
in any case congratulations i look

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.360
forward to

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:37.519
receiving you and your fellow colleagues

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.920
at the doctoral awards ceremony at the

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:40.399
end

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.920
of this month i have taken the liberty

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:44.560
of reserving seats there

their

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.360
in some sense featuring in your research

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.079
i confess an interest in meeting

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.519
