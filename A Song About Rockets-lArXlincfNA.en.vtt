00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:06.589
It started out in China in the early thirteen hundreds when they stumbled upon gunpowder (was probably by accident) [and] mostly would just use

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.519
It for their fireworks and weapons then it took five Mormon centuries for us to give a **** again

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.470
A little Later Isaac

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.720
Newton worked out how the planets stay in orbit around the sun

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.199
And how the galaxies all got that way maybe we can use the stuff for getting to the Moon one day?

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.189
But chill out mate that's still [200] years and one U.S. away, but no one really knew if you could breathe outside the atmosphere

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.369
So maybe it'd be smarter if we all just played it safe down here. Nah screw It Let's go

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.469
Do it space is taunting us and Mars looks pretty dope

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.089
The Rockets back then in the 1900s were all solid fuel and Robert goddard came up with a three-stage plan to upgrade all combustion chamber

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.170
So they were much smaller, but more powerful and everyone was like yeah, yeah, but that's just plain impractical

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.020
It wasn't because that kick-started a turning point in rocketry in other worlds at war and we're all after new technology was this being used most notably by Germany

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.329
To land people in London in the graveyard and infirmary but world war [two] is over now

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.269
And everybody's eager to snap up the german scientists who pioneered the first V2 especially America who wanted to get humans into space

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.969
But then most rockets ran on Liquid [fuels] bought the bonus of them complex thrust adjustment and mass ratio or lack thereof America adopted these improvements

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.300
Then largely because Russia's getting pushy with their Star Nerd [Sergei] [Korolev]

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.180
He gives the soviets a Rocket modeled on the Reich's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.369
V2 then spent some time in prison where he masterminds program to get people into orbit, but first animals make their debut

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.410
Woof woofski comrade laika cheers to you and [russian] the us Meanwhile trying to beat them sending humans into space

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.899
Whoever wins will celebrate with bill borscht in any case And Nasa is doing pretty good with von Braun helping out with German Smarts

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.350
Right about then Russia's time for rocketry is finally here in 1961 Yuri Gagarin left the atmosphere

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.260
Returned to Earth as someone future astronauts would soon revere

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.299
Too bad he died soon after in a jet crash [Sorry!]

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.309
America was soon to follow after with their own attempts and alan Shepard flew freedom 7 free of accidents

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.890
Though russia watch for vodka smokes and no doubt lashings of contempt

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.909
Now it's the u.s.'s turn for spacey tries at brave pre-empts

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.529
hey what's the big enormous white thing floating in the sky at night. Let's go see if that cures our frightful scientific appetite

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.619
Hey JFK stop riding around in open motorcades oh Jesus Christ!

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.209
America was sad, but the space race continued resolute then more disasters followed due to fire and twisted parachute Apollo 8 went great

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.209
[but] didn't plan to did a [lunar] loop right moon, How's it going? BRB

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.599
We're going to walk on you

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.238
Then one year later Armstrong and buzz aldrin touch the lunar floor and mankind was united in a global truce

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.390
Forevermore my god we're all so tiny and what's all this fighting even for I?

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.060
Fuck it back to work

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.909
Hey
Russia when's the next atomic war there five more missions landed on the moon and made it back again ignoring the [Thirteenth] which suffered something

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.189
Of an accident and good news, Nasa all fundings cut so like no more spacing about for a bit

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.029
And that was the last time humans ever left earth orbit, so, that's good

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.629
Isn't it we've got plenty more important things to be doing like walking around collecting

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.239
Imaginary Japanese water demons on our phone very crucial to our species development

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.209
Team mystic represent by the way will bathe in the blood of our enemies

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.169
So now the u.s. Took the moon the russians cannot barely wait to get ahead or leave a legacy behind at any rate

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.910
Let's launch a bunch of space stations, then goodbye to the soviet state the iss was next up there and now we all collaborate

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.520
to explore the planets near and far

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.630
We mostly just use probes these days because space is kind of dangerous and full of deadly Cosmic Rays and human

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.729
explorations cool but probes are cheap and patience pays

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.049
and Juneau is now in Jupiter, but Mars gets or the Twitter praise well

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.910
Hopefully, we'll colonize the solar system sometime soon and take ourselves a greater or hovel on a martian moon lets pray

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.249
We just stay cool 'cause Total Recall didn't look much fun at all

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.620
Nasa's Budgets pretty small

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.290
But now there's a new

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.340
substitute because private

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.099
Corporations help our astronauts with their commute that's one small step for man next time it might be with a nikey boot and Elon Musk's

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.100
a cooler Tony stark with out the robot suit

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.820
We're doubtless

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.309
[let's] just beginning on our Journey on Beyond the skies for perils and delights my mind waves take us by surprise a message to our grandchildren

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.310
Let's hope you're more evolved and wise

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.220
But most of all good luck cause  heaven knows you'll fucking need it guys.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.920
