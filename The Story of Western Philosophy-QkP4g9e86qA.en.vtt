00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.939
In the beginning was the word, and the

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.220
word was..............

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.400
What? I don't know.. Bird?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.840
Omelette? Vajazzle? Who knows? But there

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.340
was stuff and some guys in ancient

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.570
Greece wanted to know why there was

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.640
stuff so they invented philosophy, which

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.800
means literally "love of wisdom" or in

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.230
some translations "I hate this degree,  but

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.029
science had loads of numbers in it."

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.380
Now, to begin with there were these guys

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.029
called the pre-Socratics, and they mostly

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.740
sat around pondering stuff like "What is

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.210
the nature of the universe?", "What

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.920
regulates physical processes?", "Which

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.559
slaves should I pork next?" etc.. and that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.120
was fine, but everything really got going

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.620
when this guy turned up either called

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.290
Socrates, Sokrates or as we shall

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.700
henceforth refer to him-

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.500
Billy Big Bollocks ™

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.399
He mostly wandered around Greece asking

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.230
irritating questions, and Athens got

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.910
quite pissed about this and sentenced

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.620
him to not living. He also never wrote

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.280
anything down -

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.170
but luckily his student Plato did- and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.660
crafted a fairly whack philosophy that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.760
still shapes our lives today. So let's do

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.859
part of it really quickly- "This is a cat,

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.800
this is a cat, this is a cat also, they're

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.359
all different cats but we still get

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.369
they're cats, so there must be a perfect cat

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.180
living in some perfect room above us

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.659
that all cats are made from"™. He also had

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.310
a student called Aristotle- who did

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.860
nothing that spectacular -just basically

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.310
shaped, you know "Modern Logic"™

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.810
Aristotle also argued that what separates humans

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.580
from the animal kingdom is our ability

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.650
to reason and not much else- an idea you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.220
will find everywhere in the modern age.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.729
"Not bad chaps, and now you're all dead."

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.890
However, the Greeks left a legacy behind

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.600
that we still feel today,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.549
stuff like: hedonism- which back then

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.650
didn't mean being a selfish dick, but

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.299
rather just maximizing your own pleasure

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.060
and being cheerful. Atomism- which is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.650
where we originally got the idea of

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.350
well I mean, look at those little guys, they're

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.290
nice aren't they. And then Scepticism-
 which well~

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.420
I'd like to see some bloody proof for

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.760
that one if I'm honest :P

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.840
Anyway, the Dark Ages came along and fuck all

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.310
happened in Europe for about a thousand

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.040
years, well I mean it did obviously, we're

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.149
just not going to talk about it. And

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.340
around the 11th century universities as

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.170
we know them popped up in Spain, France,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.270
and England [Represent]. And for the next

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.619
few centuries everyone was into this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.180
thing called Scholasticism™ - which was

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.890
basically quite God-y, and was all about

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.660
trying to marry ancient Greek thought to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.490
Christian thought, with um..

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.340
shall we say 'varying results?'

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.870
This bloke St. Anselm, came up with the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.370
ontological argument for the proof of

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.500
God, which people still use today, and it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.540
goes a little like this- "Imagine a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.610
perfect video game, the idea of a perfect

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.440
video game will be even more perfect if

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.390
it actually existed which would make it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.910
super duper perfect™, therefore a perfect

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.580
video game must exist- So where the fuck

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.980
is it Gabe?! About a century later, we

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.600
get Ockham's razor- which goes something

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.930
like "Why is France a thing? Welllll, either

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.880
malevolent aliens came down in the night

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.830
yesterday, created France and all of its

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.510
peoples™, and altered all of world history,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.520
in a conspiratorial attempt to subvert

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.450
the course of pastry forever.. Or

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.430
possibility two - Maybe it's just been there

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.180
for ages? So.. maybe it's just been there for ages?..

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.060
"The simpler explanation is

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.770
generally the correct one." The black

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.050
death, then kindly wiped out about 40% of

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.790
Europeans and everyone got a bit

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.630
health-conscious..

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.580
Around the 15th, century everyone stopped

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.230
getting wankered everyday and switched

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.390
to coffee- which maybe contributed to the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.920
Renaissance- which literally means

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.080
rebirth™, where we got all nostalgic for

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.760
the Greeks and Romans again. Columbus

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.680
discovered some shit, da Vinci drew some shit,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.690
Shakespeare wrote some shit.. Things

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.580
were really picking up. During the 18th

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.470
century the Age of Enlightenment began-

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.540
A modern philosophy took shape and if

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.950
you've ever heard someone yell at a

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.050
philosophy major- "Yeah, but if you work in

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.330
Starbucks do you really exist?"™. Well you

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.040
can thank a single Frenchman for this,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.460
called Renal Dick Art™ or Renè Descartes.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.440
And one of his big ideas, was very very

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.110
briefly- 'Let's assume we doubt everything,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.720
What can we know for certain? Wellll, does

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.120
the world exist? -Dunno™. Does my

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.580
country exist? -Dunno™. Does Gilbert

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.070
Gottfried exist? -Dunno™. Do I exist?

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.920
-Dunno™. Am I thinking? -Yes.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.620
Does that mean I exist? -Yes! Is the answer

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.920
Gilbert Gottfried? What? no..™ Does it have a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.050
tail? -No, that doesn't even.. What are you

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.390
talking about? -ah then even if everything

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.920
is a dream, and everyone else is

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.900
fictional, at least I know I'm a thing

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.560
because I'm thinking- which must mean,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.380
I think, therefore I...

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.620
Wait, is it Emma Stone?

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.760
NO FOR FUCK'S SAKE!!. (Akinator™)

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.840
Meanwhile, over in Britain, John Locke and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.250
David Hume, are cooking up this thing

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.349
called Empiricism™- which mostly says, "Look

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.240
knowledge comes from the outside world,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.400
not sitting around smoking a fatty, and

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.409
having a think, you idiots, there's also some

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.120
other stuff going on- Thomas Hobbes who's

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.129
also British [Represent™]. Says humans are

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:36.870
nasty by Nature, and we need the 'Social

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.520
contract.' Adam Smith, more or less

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.550
invented modern economics, and in 1724

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.650
Immanuel Kant was born-who we shall

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.860
henceforth refer to as

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.780
Walter Big Wang™

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.520
-And and proceeded to tear philosophy,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.240
A new one™

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.400
"Don't be silly" he said, "Rationalism and

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.500
empiricism could work together. Everyone

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.960
just shut up, read my books, be cool."

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.669
By the way, humans have categories™ in

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:57.810
their heads, which define how they

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.159
perceive the world, and will never be

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.750
able to experience the really-real-world™,

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.789
because we're not God. If you want to be

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.800
moral, just act in a way that if everyone

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.330
did it it will be alright, and finally

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.800
#check yourself before you wreck yourself.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.349
#wash your hands after toilet time.

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.110
#Mic drop. Tchüss!! [Goodbye] This sparked a whole new

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.669
movement in philosophy- called German

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.469
idealism. The king of that cartel,

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.240
a guy called Hegel, and mostly they all

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.159
wanted to know, "what you can know about

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.469
objects that we know you can't know

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.140
anything about, because.. we can't know

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.300
anything...

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.860
about them..." ™®©

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.800
Over in America, pragmatism is getting

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.820
started, which when something like -

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.130
All right, Europe. Lovely ideas, but do they work in

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.220
practice? If yes, good✓

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.940
If not then maybe just...

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.080
sssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhshut the fuck up✓

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.914
Natural philosophy, which was the study of the natural world,

00:05:52.914 --> 00:05:54.649
by then is being called science™. Science,

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:56.479
also now has the scientific-method™. The

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.519
basic rules of which are- If you notice

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:00.469
weird shit, think about why it happened,

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.389
test your theory, if your theory works✔,

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.129
let other people check it, and if it

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.179
doesn't, then yeah, well done anyway,

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:10.759
Have a.. a biscuit or something ?
Meanwhile

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.589
German philosopher and all-around nice

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.929
guy Nietzsche, hated everyone including

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:16.669
God, who he killed, and said the

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:17.899
civilization was heading towards

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:19.669
catastrophe, and there's no structure to

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.320
the world except what we give it- which

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.920
will be important in a moment-

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.400
P.S. Nothing means anything, and we're all gonna die :D  -Morty Sanchez

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.439
And we're into the 20th century, by now

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:28.999
philosophy has official categories

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:31.519
namely: epistemology©- can we know shit?

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:33.589
metaphysics©- how does shit ultimately work?

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.320
ethics©- how do we know good shit from bad shit?

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.140
Logic©- how do we reason shit?

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.940
and aesthetics©- why this shit looks so nice.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.079
And there are loads of new

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:43.789
movements, popping up such as

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.189
existentialism©- which said look, you're

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.599
free in the world and that might suck,

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:49.249
but just roll with it mate, you can

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:50.689
define yourself™, and people started

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:52.159
asking lots of questions- like how does

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.989
sentience work? And other such things as

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:56.149
human rights, and no seriously is it

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.249
Gilbert Gottfried? And there's this thing

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:00.409
happening called post-modernism, which

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:03.469
well it's hard to...yeah ok, so there was

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:05.629
modernism right, look at this- modern

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:07.669
isn't it? There are rules and forms and

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:09.050
stuff, but eventually some people got

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.789
bored of it and said, "Well, there's no real

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.709
narrative to anything, and everything is

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:14.809
interpretation"- except for that statement

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.610
for some reason- and stuff like this

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:23.119
happened.. And this.. yeah..mm.. Anyway, yeah..

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.729
So.. where are we now,

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.939
Well... recently, philosophy has largely

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:30.709
boiled down to moral questions.

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:32.569
Is abortion a right? How should you run a

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:34.549
society? Can we use science to determine

00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:36.529
morality? And that's the state of things

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:38.599
today. These days science is hoovering up

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.099
lots of big questions that started in

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:42.079
philosophy, like- What is matter made of?

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:44.029
And how do living things work? and stuff.. and

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:45.529
even if you think philosophy has no

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:46.219
purpose anymore,

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:49.399
that's fine, but it did once. There was a

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:51.169
time, when it was the mother of almost

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:52.879
all knowledge, and if you should be so

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.919
brave or silly, as to embark on your own

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:56.539
undergraduate adventure in philosophy,

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:58.189
and people wish you all the best with a

00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:59.839
future career in telemarketing, just

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:00.889
quietly remember

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:02.900
there is yet work to be done. We still

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.919
don't know what we're doing here.

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:05.749
Consciousness is still a mystery

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:07.580
The origin of matter is still a mystery,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.110
SO YOU HEAR THAT, DAD?

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.080
With reference to all your bullshit..

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:11.620
DAD.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.719
Well yeah, I might be nearing 30, and fine,

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:16.520
I picked the wrong degree, I get it,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.169
And no, I still don't know what the stock

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:20.479
market is, or when the post comes, or how

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:21.919
to shave my testicles without

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:23.990
inadvertently castrating myself, but by the

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.330
power of Grayskull, if someone held us up

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.370
at gunpoint, and shouted "You better

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.990
extensively explain Aristotle's

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.060
position on dogs or you're both fucking

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.099
dead!" Let's just say I'd be walking home

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.140
a hero that night, so put that in your

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.349
pipe and smoke it, DAD! Not so fucking

00:08:39.349 --> 00:08:42.440
funny anymore is it, DAD? Who's. Laughing.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.820
NOW. *Dad.*

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.860
And then, [coughs] if could maybe just hurry up,

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.680
and send me that money for rent

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.780
that'd be great [squeaks]

00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:08.680
